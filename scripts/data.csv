1,ageless a lot of people who are going to watch this video have never played chess before how would you explain chess to them I would start off with the basics by teaching them how to move the pieces like the pawns Knights Queens Bishops Kings what's the goal of the whole game well the goal of the game is trap the king and attack it at the same time yes so it can't run away yeah exactly and also take all of their pieces yeah for me I would describe chess as a lot of what you said and also it's a mix of really quick plans like tactics and then things that can take four five six seven moves like like a plan like a strategy so let's practice in this position I had the white pieces you're playing on my side my opponent was playing with the black pieces so we switched a little bit so if I said hey you get three moves in a row can you come up with a plan I think I could if I have three moves in a row I'd probably Checkmate them with Rook H3 Queen H4 and then Queen takes H7 Checkmate I'm very happy that's the first plan that you came up with right you can bring your queen out this way or the Rook you can start with both and then you come here and then you Checkmate but I did say white gets three moves in a row right but that's how we have to think about plans right we have to think about okay well if I get a couple of moves in a row what would I like to accomplish what does my opponent want to do so I'm not just going to sit here and get checkmated hopefully right so what do you think I want to do in this position I think my king is on bad scare right now so maybe you're trying to like trade and then somehow get an attack on my king oh you're saying like if I take this Pawn maybe in the future I'll try to open up this diagonal to that's that's very good Vision there's some pieces in the way but yes in chess you have to always keep an eye on what can possibly open do you know how you can tell whether a position is closed or open usually when a position is closed pieces are more squished together the easiest way by far to figure out if a position is closed is how many pawns do we eat Che right now it's eight so think of it like a fence right so if you and your neighbor have a full fence you can't really see each other but if there's only four pawns that means somebody probably knocked down half of the fence right so if we start picking up all these pawns then the position is more open so this would be a close position this type of strategy would be called an attacking strategy cuz you found a way to get your queen and Rook down this line against my king before we even talk about what tactic is here who does it look like is winning this game I think White's winning okay why do you think so well the black king is very exposed into the white side of the board and like the white king is a bit more safe yes you're 100% right cuz in chess the two most important things we have to think about are who has more material but then like you said who has the weaker King and I would say my King has gone way too far right so there's a tactic here for white um maybe is it Bishop takes Pawn on before so that's like immediately you get a reward but I'll give you a hint the best way to start looking for a tactic always look for a check first do you have a way to attack my king yes look H1 so exactly you would give me that check now where can my king go let's just try to think um your king can go to King D4 yes that's my only move so I would go here now what else is on that diagonal um the look yes and which of your pieces can the bishop the bishop so so do you know what this type of tactic is called a skuba yes well done and then I would take the pawn and then I would take the rook and then you would take the Rook now the funny thing is you are now totally winning right but as we know in chess maybe one day white will make a mistake in the future so there's no point for black to surrender here but this is definitely a really good 
2,start how long have you been playing chess I played a little bit of Chess growing up against my brothers but ever since the Queen's Gambit show came out that's I think when I downloaded downloaded the app and started playing against friends for fun so chess has separated into three games obviously you have your opening which is the early stage of the game then we have the middle game right the most confusing mysterious side of the game and and the end game where there's no pieces remaining on the board you got to have to know how to convert positions defend positions understand how to play the game with only five pieces remaining or something like that so for you what do you struggle with the most yeah I would say I really struggle in the mid game I feel like I've developed most of my pieces try to control the center but at a certain point I'm a little bit stuck on like okay now what what do I do so I'm going to look up your account we're going to pick a game and we're going to analyze it sounds good in all middle games we have this mix of tactics which are immediate gain or immediate loss depending on if we're getting hit with a tactic or playing one and strategic chess I just want you to tell me who do you think has a better position here and by how much to me right now it feels pretty even like there's no major vulnerabilities from both sides but I guess the white pieces the pieces are a little bit more developed I would say everything you just said is 100% accurate so that's one of those Baseline pieces of information that we need for the middle game I have the two Bishops how can I activate one of my Bishops you have a little plan you could actually Implement right now that would make one of your Bishops extremely strong you think you can find it if I had a guess I think it probably moving this bishop here you definitely want to get the bishop out but you don't want to move it just yet so how do you do that I am not sure this is how we unlock the intermediate level which is this move that move looks like it's disconnecting from the whole board right it's a move totally on the edge but nobody is going to stop your Bishop from going to that diagonal and then you're threatening a tactic yeah you're threatening a skewer you would hit my queen and my Rook stronger piece in front weaker piece in back and then you would be guaranteed to win some material just like little pattern recognition in the middle game so for the future you're going to have a game where your opponent makes same trade early right they trade their dark squired bishop and you can activate it like that but in this game you focused on the center which was totally fine also maybe one question I have is like as I'm also looking at this position just trying to understand like okay what is my opponent trying to do here one thing to always monitor in every chess middle game is does my opponent have a pawn break can my opponent strike somewhere with a pawn that would open up the board if you have a lowrisk position your position's just nice and comfortably better you don't want chaos I guess maybe they would try to advance their middle Pawn yes and this move is actually very annoying for white because not only am I now targeting things in your Center what else have I changed just by moving this Pawn uh now their Bishop is activated yesh another thing for Middle games so we just keep adding to that bucket of knowledge Pawn breaks for the opponent and then every time something moves like a pawn we have to look around what else is now opening up and we want to get to a situation where you knew this move was going to and then next I'm going to come here and then now what can I do I can bring both my Rooks M and now I have no problems right now I have both Knights Queen Rooks so we need to get to a point where we see that coming and we're not just focusing on our own plans but that's not always easy so with Pawn here that disrupts my plan yeah right because now this move fails to yeah respond to the skewer yes as you're trying to improve your middle game one question you always have to ask yourself is is that trade good for me is it good for my opponent opponent it's not Checkers you don't have to take me and I don't have to take you so we can do something called keeping the tension we're just having a staring contest here among the pawns so I'm going to ask you do you think it's better for black to capture this Pawn or keep the tension just slide The Rook over and threaten to push the pawn here which would be a tactic and a fork if I was black I would Advance the pawn because I think knowing that black has two knights and I have have two Bishops they would want more of a closed game yes but before we advance we need we need to prepare it right because you push it now right these two would win that trade so yeah rookie 8 is is is a very good move you used kind of like a Uris right well black has two knights so black prefers the position closed because the side with the Bishops wants to be able to see the whole board yes exactly but your opponent disagreed with you and took this Pawn Yeah because that's just what intermediate players do they see they can take something Pawn for Pawn what the heck like sure and you did this now what does this move change in the white position so that opened up the diagonal for my dark Square Bishop yep here yeah and what else what else did that move open up uh it opened up the E file for us yes exactly so now in the snap of your fingers you can get your Bishop out and a rook two things that a move ago were just totally blocked in by a pawn exactly so in the middle game trades are either good or bad for you and for your opponent mhm you know I'm in the mid game right now but what do I need to do or learn in order to take it up another level to a more advanced player style it's a lot of practice and Analysis really an advanced chess player was not born an advanced chess player they have probably hundreds if not thousands of more games in their mind in their past in their history that they've analyzed that they've studied it's like any athlete you know I put my weight on this foot and so I wasn't able to hit the shot back that well so the next time that that happens I'm going to be more
3,prepared I'm wearing a black hoodie black pants you definitely have more style than me today so in chess people have style too yeah what's your playing style I'm I'll say quite aggressive like I really want to win the game fast so as we move up the levels today we want to start introducing slightly more advanced terms one of them is called initiative but what exactly does that mean to you so like if you're in a battle you win a certain spot right a really important spot that gives you initiative when you get something right that you want then it can start building up it can start building up to be better and better bigger and bigger when you find a Target and you have a way to create threats attacks against that Target against that goal but you do it without sacrificing your resources right so imagine two boxers right one is being pushed into a corner he could still win he could totally still win but for now one side is definitely the aggressor and have an issue exactly has the initiative you're a tactical aggressive player you're always looking for the initiative me too why don't we play a Blitz game good luck look okay okay that's not the opening I remember you playing we've played in the park we've played online wonder how many games we played against each other um we've played I think probably like including over theb and online maybe like 9 10 games okay so we have like just like a regular finetto see this is not the ttin I remember T it's quite slow it's a very solid you know steady approach there's nothing wrong with it okay let's see very balanced actually I had this chest opening really recently and I lost that game and it was very painful and very sad I feel like black has more space would you say black has more initiative not yet not yet but considering the way I said it it's like you follow up of something so you just attack my D and I move back so you kind of you have the initiative the tough thing about Chess is you can have a good position but you actually have to move pieces you know like a piece of art you just say oh it's done so chess is different from art chest is different from art let's go here we go here okay let's go here okay let's see I'll go here just in case I don't I don't know let's okay I'm just going to like take more space from you is this quite like a just a wow just a position you know what we've been talking about initiative I think I just got to go for it I just got to like got to push all my pawns that could be good that could be bad I I have to deal with it at some point no you don't wow wow just in case cuz I feel like my position is it's like a fortress so feels like I can do moves like Rook H1 doesn't help my position if you don't attack but think it's just good to be just steady I'm stunned okay you know what I'm going to go bring more pieces to help more pieces to help okay look at all the how are you just ignoring all my my whole Squad is over there I want to take space wow I mean I got to go for it right I I feel like we have to okay I really feel like this is a nice example of black has an initiative yeah black definitely has an ini black has an initiative but can black capitalize on this initiative I don't know the problem with having a position like this is you feel a lot of pressure to do something if I was black I want to end the game like right now you want to end the game right now yeah okay let's see what can I do okay I'll do that okay try roll up the sleeves okay yeah that's the chess player sign of focus just yeah and you R just SLE I guess I have to defend my Pawn I mean don't really want to but fine now I'll will be anointed take us much pieces off I will take back would have been nice if you didn't but okay now maybe we go up and I will take that PA that was all part of the plan was very greedy move of you all right let's see here now I'll take a p all right let's see what I'm scared okay can do that yes do that the board looks different in this building are you up a pawn no six six each we good um ah that king of yours just saying just saying that king of yours come back come back I go forward no o I have to block with my Rook this is the tiny game in the tournament all over again no I almost lost on time yeah I have no idea what to do me too by the way ah that is your Rook trapped but like I can't actually take it that's so weird check wait what okay oh I like having more time that's nice think I'll take those pawns can I like go eat the other ponds no I can't keep going whoa yes keep going no I can stop you I yes I can can you wait can you ah okay oh my gosh no my Bishop nice game game oh that was 
4,crazy generally in five levels level five is the ultimate master the person that's played the game 20 30 years has the highest pedigree actually that's you in this case and we're still on level four because computers have been better than humans at chess for like 30 years how has it changed the way you approach the game yeah I mean I think chess players are using computers intensively all the time obviously with some material odds it's going to be one part of the training and other part of the training that I find interesting is like you know to find positions from let's say real life tournaments and i' I've been doing that actually from this recent tournament that's going on in Isle of Man playing out some of those fascinating positions and just seeing what the computer does and he's like coming up with resources that you would never think of you know today we've been talking a lot about how chess is kind of a mix of tactics versus strategy let's elevate that discussion so what is chess to you well the way my coach explained chess to me that uh really seems intuitive is that chess is a game of time space and Harmony you have one turn to get things done right obviously you try to make it as efficient as possible we have the saying in chess that you know you lost by one tempo by one move space you know we have a game of 64 squares right so control over these 64 squares of what the game is about you can get control moving up your pawns you can get control by winning a opponent's material right so obviously that's another big element that we're fighting over and Harmony is basically like you got this Army of pieces right your job is to make them work well with each other coordinate them and build that beautiful picture of Harmony that you know all chess players aim for and are so pleased when they can finally achieve so I've never thought of Chess that way this is very interesting to me so of those three what would you say is the one that you have more Mastery over than the other Harmony trumps everything it trumps like you could be winning when it's not your return and you're like totally behind in material so it shows you that Harmony is the end goal chess is a miniature life I always like to say that chess exposes all of your flaws on the board your training habits in the way you approach certain positions so you say you can see yourself on the chessboard who is enena on the chessboard yeah well I think enena is a fighter you know enena is not someone who likes to give up Irina is someone who wants to leave everything on the board right like every last drop that's the that's the idea how do you see yourself as a player I think I like to be creative so I find fun in Chess By learning 10 different openings trying different positions I like chaotic positions I like positions where I can attack I like positions where I'm getting attacked and I can maybe defend and find some creative way to turn things around and I really really struggle when I need to sit there and just do nothing so you know we have opposite Styles Levy I think our Blitz game is going to be a lot of fun all right if I had to guess I I'd guess you're a king's Indian player no I I see that's an opening that requires a lot of uh time and practice and dedication and I'm but I'll I'll play something also still fun okay the Dutch defense is that the Leningrad I think G6 is Leningrad this this I don't I don't I've tried to find a name I don't actually know the name of this one I guess there's also like the Stonewall right you can play yeah all right let's go for the most solid move that's not fun we don't want double pawns no we don't I would have liked double pawns okay let's complete that Bishop fenet okay so you actually play The Dutch that's not just like today's surprise I play like a lot of openings poorly that's my approach to chess I just play things that I think will be fun then the game starts going and I'm like why did I play this I should learn real openings okay I guess I'll yeah this is yeah nice and nice and boring yeah prefer it wasn't boring I think I got to do something like on the queen side here before you get your E5 moveing I was debating playing a55 question is is E5 a good move or a bad move there's only one way to find out so yeah you're going to go for it yeah all right well I got to take you can I take with the pawn probably E5 looks a little dangerous but guess we can analyze that later all right so what are you threatening at the moment not much yeah if I take an E5 it gets very boring I can also do something like now it's a good thing that like my queen is not going to hang when you take my night yes oh well it's not it's actually it's not a good thing I would have preferred that it might you know it might hang but we only have like 90 seconds we have to make conversation and also play some semi- decent that's what streamers do right like back I do YouTube you know okay I think we can yeah got to save my queen so we're going to recapture like that what if I do this what if I just don't acknowledge what you're trying that's interesting right cuz I don't have A3 I can play B5 was kind of interesting yeah I have C6 but you can play B6 I can take on D6 looks a little boring not plausible the average player would want five more minutes now I think I think this move is kind of interesting so we're going to go for that okay it's a pawn sacrifice yeah sort of temporary but I'm trying to keep your Rook closed guess I take right I feel like that's so we're trying to get the pawn back I think this idea to keep talking during the game was really good by me yes I strategize before the game started I play best when I have no time on the clock that's uh so if I take an F7 you take with the king so I don't really get anywhere with that so I guess I got to take this Pawn so I I was going for this position I kind of like it okay I think my plan here was to go here then your C7 Pawn Yeah is is kind of stuck forever plus to get the tempo on your Rook oh Bishop D5 is always an idea too oh wow I think you got some isues here Levy think you should just think for like 47 more seconds and then then you should make your decision all right h i mean I have some really tempting moves here this was just information overload just give too many possibilities and then all right all right it's kind of hard to decide here let's not try not to win the game right away wow that surprised me you're sacking The Exchange all right yes I will okay do we just go for counterplay maybe going for counterplay was not very smart maybe it was like very not smart M wow okay okay so I guess we should bring the Rooks in this is the most fun part of the game when you have 4 seconds you just have to very fun um okay this Mo like really terrible let's just do it now the game could theoretically go sorry that's no fun no it's like a really important Pond there no and that pond is also really important why would you take both of my really important FS yeah yeah yeah okay and I lost on time double wh that was exciting though this was probably my best move of the the game right and taking my Rook yeah yes yeah this is the subtle stuff Levy that we you know build a game out of yeah but I think yeah but it's ugly it's ugly because just in general like this position I think is kind of ugly yes you know you're stuck with this Pawn you're stuck with this Pawn question King should you play A4 because if you don't play A4 now can I play a can you play A4 yeah that's a question I mean okay like so like you mean if I let you play a move like that I still think like you're going to feel like now I you're going to have like more problems like even if I have like a pawn here it's still annoying but then if I start generating some some play yeah you can try a little trap you see it do you see it do you see that Bishop this position is not not fun it's tough because you got some issues with the King some issues with the Rook with the pawns you know but I think yeah like in terms exposes who you are as a person I just have many issues that's what your move was interesting and it kind of posed this this uh big decision in front of me right like over here so I think in terms of like strategy this was really the key moment strategically because I have to like make this big decision with the pawn structure and so this one kind of prevented your Rook from opening up on this file and I I keep my pressure on the queen side so this is a perfect example of time space and Harmony Allin one move yeah that's right that's right we're fighting for space we're fighting to not let the opponent build Harmony yeah B5 I didn't even consider I just thought you would either take or push or but yeah this game went more in my style of I listen to you carefully talk about all all the things that you liked about Chess and I tried I now I know what to do against it that's what always happens okay I have a personal question now yeah you are the eight time United States women's chess champion you also have the highest title in all of Chess Grandmaster I'm an eternal runnerup like what is the championship mentality and how have you succeeded at it so many times in terms of The Grandmaster title that's like um I think everyone's personal Journey right it can take some people longer I actually did it very late in my life I don't know Levy if you know this but I made grandmas when I was 29 most people if they don't do it by the time they're like 20 they'll probably never do it in terms of becoming a grandmas really it's like that that's the time and the commitment I think if you're an international Master like you are like everything is Within Reach like you're already play chess long enough in your life you're close enough to that level that really it's going to be little things like putting in the time going to the best tournaments and getting the best competition and just maybe getting a good coach to help you as well so I it's not too late Levy okay we're going to look forward to Gotham chess making grandmas yeah then I'll retire and I don't know do horse racing or
5,"something tell me a little bit about yourself do you play chess so I do play chess um I played as a kid I remember learning from my grandfather when we lived in in India but I got recently more interested in it when my kids started playing chess in school in New York kids play Chess at a very young age one was my heart and it it's you know it gets more and more intense and he's playing tournaments and I thought let me try to keep up with him and I realized that I could kind of do it in my work as well because I study Ai and I study um computer science in general what type of AI are we talking chat Bots we talking I don't I I don't know the terms there's all kinds so I try to create what I call human oriented AI so I try to use AI to understand human behavior what makes humans decide and make the decisions they that they do and we thought wouldn't it be interesting to try to create an AI that actually tries to play like humans at different levels and tries to mimic their behavior so that's we what we set out to do with Maya generally the chess board does not care you feel I think is how AI plays right it's sort of just figuring out the best move you're right that AI is trying to play the best way possible and it's combining this evaluation function with this the search it's powering it with Brute Force like it can do millions of searches a second I think some of the components of the evaluation function map to some of the things humans do when they look at a chessboard right when they're thinking about their King being unsafe even that emotion you described feel uncomfortable like I feel uncomfortable whenever I've castled and I push that gpon or something but that feeling translates to some of the components of the evaluation function that's stockfish uses humans don't have this luxury of searching millions of nodes a second I can't even finish one node without going oh what about the second node right as you get deeper and deeper the tree it just grows and grows expands like combinator and it starts getting very confusing and your evaluation starts getting less and less accurate you might make mistakes because you might miss something and less and less confident which is an emotion which the computer doesn't feel one thing that we noticed when I was talking with a colleague of mine his name is Ashton Anderson he's a professor at University of Toronto he was in my lab and we both had this passion for chess but we realized no one had really used AI to play like a human would play I think my audience once pulled 92% are below the level of 1,00 but it's really hard to learn chess because you don't get to experience learning content based on people who are your level like how did you really deduce how a 1200 will play we use state-ofthe-art neural networks like Alpha Zer and Lela but we Instead try to predict what move a human would make given a board position is these deep neural Nets are kind of like black boxes so we've come up with interesting ways to prob at them to get an idea of okay what Isa is going on that is different about this person or different about that person we had like a style vctor for each person we can compare those see where you defer and try to map those back to human understandable chess Concepts because that's a key right if I just tell you oh they theer and the third number and the fifth number you'll be like what does that even mean right but if I can tell you oh I think this person worries more about their King safety or sacrifices their Center at the cost of protecting their king or something like that some kind of trade-off then you might be able understand what's what's going on there so that's what we're trying to do now with with these style vectors and the fun thing about having numbers representing people is that you can add them together you can mix them with something like like Maya do you think it's possible to develop some sort of accurate measure let's say I'm a 1200 I have an opening course I just want to practice my opening yeah can I do it some way against Maya or I think that's actually a good idea and I agree with you that it's not something you can easily access today and like out with the online tools and the chess platforms that are out there I play the Caron and when I learned it I started getting afraid of so when you go I started getting afraid of yeah the advance the advance and even more so at some point when I like I I always like to get my Bishop out because I feel very uncomfortable if I don't and then eventually something happens this Pond making its way over here used to scare me and I never experienced this in any you know looking at the openings and because I would not know what to do I would take it I would get in trouble and even if they if I let them take I would yeah you'd have to move your king my king and so I remember hitting all these variations that just that just scared me pawn to E5 on the third move is the most challenging move against the carocon it restricts the KN and the main line so the move is bringing out this so you don't get locked right I play that move but the move that I also added to my toolbox and is the only move I teach now is this move to to try to undermine the center it's not commonly played at the highest level if you study Master games this is probably one in every six games or something compared to right so now we go down a totally different path we're taking a totally different train to our destination but just this undermining of the position you know splitting up these pawns and then slowly capturing them both that does wonders at intermediate and early Advance level this move despite it being move three according to databases already give gives black like a 53% chance of winning which is crazy because normally white is about 52% white just doesn't know what to do is that like like human empirically though based on the games that people are play yeah like I would say is a stockfish ofal like we uh for black computer computer after like 12 13 moves says white is better white is better okay but what does that really mean right in practice in practice yeah even in Grandmaster level chess okay move 13 white is better and move 20 black is equal I love this because this is an example of the kind of advice at as you said in the intermediate and advanced level that could be appropriate because you're thinking about the human opponent that you're playing and maybe you wouldn't recommend this at the highest highest levels but in that range I think it could very well be very good advice and as they get more comfortable with it and understand it your students at some point they might realize you know what I've progressed to a point where I don't want to play that anymore and they'll change but for a good part of time it could be very uh useful for them in 1997 Kasparov lost to deep blue we can say for about 26 years now ai has been better than humans in chess but where do we go from here thinking about Chess first of all I have to hand it to Alpha zero and and Leela and these other engines because I think they have sometimes given us interesting ideas they've shown Sparks of creativity that have inspired the way humans play in but I agree with you that right now you know you look at the the tcac competitions and they're just kind of getting better and better a little bit better a little bit better a little bit more data maybe a deeper newal Network and you know these advances I don't find that interesting I'm more interested in trying to get better and better at creating humanlike presence and human-like avatars when it comes to chess or when it comes to other games so I feel like you know within 5 years we'll probably have a lot of human like like entities that we can interact in in Virtual settings not just because of the rise of large language models and the ability to converse and speak and produce texts like humans but hopefully the ability to produce actions like humans too I hope you enjoyed this episode of five levels and before you go I just want to say that it's probably one of the most unique episodes because our ages did not go up from low age to a higher age chess doesn't really care about any of that just give it a try it is ever evolving and The Learning Journey is really never over when you play "
1,hello world my name is David J Ma and I'm a professor of computer science at Harvard University today I've been asked to explain algorithms in five levels of increasing difficulty algorithms are important because they really are everywhere not only in the physical world but certainly in the virtual world as well and in fact what excites me about algorithms is that they really represent an opportunity to solve problems and I dare say no matter what you do in life all of us have problems to solve so I'm a computer science professor so I spend a lot of time with computerss how would you define a computer for them well a computer is electronic like a phone but it's um a rectangle and you like can type like tick tick tick and you work on it nice do you know any of the parts that are inside of a computer um no can I explain a couple of them to you yeah so like inside of every computer is some kind of brain and the technical term for that is CPU or Central processing unit and those are the pieces of Hardware that know how to respond to those instructions like moving up or down or left or right knows how to do math like addition and subtraction and then there's at least one other type of Hardware inside of a computer called memory or Ram if you've heard of this I know memory because you have to memorize stuff yeah exactly and computers have even different types of memory they have what's called Ram random access memory which is where your games where your programs are stored while they being used but then it also has a a hard drive or a solid state drive which is where your data your high scores your documents once you start writing essays and and stories in the future stays there stays permanently so even if the power goes out the computer can still remember that information it's still there because the computer can't just like delete all the words itself because your fingers can only do that like you have to use your finger to delete all the stuff exactly have you heard of an algorithm before um yes algorithm is a list of instructions to tell people what to do or like a robot what to do yeah exactly it's so it's just stepbystep instructions for doing something for solving a problem for yeah so like if you have a bedtime routine then first you say I get dressed I brush my teeth I read a little story and then I go to bed all right well how about another algorithm like um what do you tend to eat for for lunch any types of sandwiches you like uh I eat peanut butter and let me get some supplies from the cupboard here so should we make an algorithm together for why don't we do it this way why don't we pretend like I'm a computer or maybe I'm a robot so I only understand your instructions and so I want you to feed me no pun intended an algorithm so step-by-step instructions for solving this problem but remember algorithms you have to be precise you have to give the right instructions the right instructions just do it for me soep step one was what open the bag okay opening the bag of bread stop now grab the bread and put it on the plate grab the bread and put it on the plate take all the bread back and put it back in there so that's like an undo command little control Z okay take one bread and put it on the plate take the lid off the peanut butter okay take the lid off the peanut butter put the lid down okay take the knife take the knife put the blade inside the peanut butter and spread the peanut butter on the bread I'm going to take out some peanut butter and I'm going to spread the peanut butter on the bread I put a lot of peanut butter on because I love peanut butter apparently I thought I was messing with you here but I think you're happy with this Put The Knife down and then grab one bread and put it on top of the second bread sideways sideways like put it flat on oh flat ways okay and now done you're done with your sandwich should we take a delicious bite yep let's take a bite okay here we go what would be the next step be you here clean all this mess up clean all this mess up right we made an algorithm step-by-step instructions for solving some problem and if you think about now how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches sometimes we were imprecise you didn't give me quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly and that's why I took out so much bread Precision being very very correct with your instructions is so important in the real world because for instance when you're using the worldwide web and you're searching for something on Google or being you want to do the right thing so like if you type in just Google then you won't find the answer to your question pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it because you and I are sort of following instructions either that we came up with ourselves or maybe our parents told us how to do these things and so those are just algorithms but when you start using algorithms in uh computers that's when you start writing
2,"code what do you know about algorithms nothing really um at all honestly I think it's just probably a way to store information um in computers and I dare say even though you might not have put this word on it odds are you executed as a human multiple algorithms today even before you came here today like what were a few things that you did I got ready okay and get ready what does that mean brushing my teeth brushing my hair okay put getting dressed okay so all of those frankly if we really um Dove more deeply could be broken down into stepbystep instructions and presumably your mom your dad someone in the past sort of programmed you as a human to know what to do and then after that as a smart human you can sort of take it from there and you don't need their help anymore but that's kind of what we're doing when we program computer something maybe even more familiar nowadays like odds are you have a cell phone your contacts or your dress book but let me ask you why that is like why does Apple or Google or anyone else bother alphabetizing your contacts I just assumed it would be easier to navigate what if your friend happened to be at the very bottom of this randomly organized list like why is that a problem like he or she is still there I guess it would take a while to get to while you're scrolling that in of itself is kind of a problem or it's an inefficient solution to the problem so it turns out that back in my day before there were cell phones like everyone's numbers from high schools like were literally printed in a book and everyone in my town and my city my state was printed in an actual phone book even if you've never seen this technology before how would you propose verbally to find John in this phone book or I would just flip through and just look for the J I guess yeah so let me propose that we start that way I could just start at the beginning and step by step I could just look at each page looking for John looking for John now even if you've never seen this here technology before it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing in software like someone from Google or Apple or the like they could write software that uses a technique in programming known as a loop and a loop as the word implies is just sort of do something again and again what if instead of starting from the beginning and going one page at a time what if I or what if your phone goes like two pages or two names at a time would this be correct do you think well you could skip over John I think in what sense if he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over yeah so sort of accidentally and frankly with like 50/50 probability John could get sandwiched in between two pages but does that mean I have to throw that algorithm out alt together maybe you could use that strategy until you get close to the section and then switch to going one by one okay that's nice so you could kind of like go twice as fast but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit on the highway or in this case near the J section of the book exactly and maybe alternatively if I get to like a b c d e f g h i j k if I get to the K section then I could just double back like one page just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched between those pages so the nice thing about that second algorithm is that I'm flying through the phone book like two pages at a time so 2 4 6 8 10 12 it's not perfect it's not necessarily correct but it is if I just take like one extra step so I think it's fixable but what your phone is probably doing and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents used to do back in the day is we'd probably go roughly to the middle of the phone book here and just intuitively if this is an alphabetized phone book in English what section am I probably going to find myself in roughly K okay so I'm in the K section is John going to be to the left or to the right to the left yeah so John is going to be to the left to the right and what we can do here though your phone does something smarter is tear the problem in half throw half of the problem away being left with just 500 pages now but what might I next do I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again but we've learned to do better I can go roughly to the middle here do it again yeah exactly so now maybe I'm in the E section which is a little to the left so John is clearly going to be to the right so I can again tear the problem portly in half throw this half of the problem away and I claim now that if we started with a th000 Pages now we've gone to 500 250 now we're really moving quick not on that page and I can call him roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take if I started with a th000 Pages then went to 500 250 125 like how many times can you divide 1,000 and half maybe 10 that's roughly 10 because in the first algorithm looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case might have to go all the way through thousand pages but the second algorithm you said was 500 maybe 500 in1 essentially the same thing so twice as fast but this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally faster because you're you're sort of dividing and conquering it in half and half and half not just taking one or two bites out of it at of a time so this of course is not how we used to use phone books back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only but it is how your phone is actually searching for zoy for John for anyone else but it's doing it in software oh that's cool so here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms looking for John in the phone book but the technique we just used can indeed be called divide and conquer where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer that is you try to chop it up into smaller smaller smaller pieces a more sophisticated type of algorithm at least depending on how you implement it something known as a recursive algorithm recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm that uses itself to solve the exact same problem again and again but chops it smaller and smaller and smaller"
3,ultimately hi my name is Patricia Patricia nice to meet you where are you a student at I'm starting my senior year now at NYU oh nice and what have you been studying the past few years I study computer science and data science if you were chatting with a non-cs nonata science friend of yours like how would you explain to them what an algorithm is some kind of like systematic way of like solving a problem or like a set of like steps to kind of solve a certain like problem you have so you probably recall learning topics like binary search versus linear search and the like so I've come here uh complete with a actual chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on it here like how would you tell a friend to sort these I think one of the first things we learned was something called bubble sort it was kind of like focusing on like smaller like bubbles I guess I would say it like of the problem like looking at like smaller segments rather than like the whole thing at once what is I think very true about what you're hinting at is that bubble sort really focuses on like local small problems rather than taking a step back trying to fix the whole thing let's just fix the obvious problem in front of us so for instance when we're trying to get from smallest to largest and the first two things we see are eight followed by one this looks like a problem cuz it's out of order so what would be the simplest fix the least amount of work we can do to at least fix one problem just like switch those two numbers cuz one is obviously smaller than eight perfect so we just swap those two then you would switch those again yeah so that further improves the situation and you can kind of see it that the one and the two are now in place how about 8 and six switch it again switch those again 8 and three switch it again and conversely now the one and the two are closer to and coincidentally are exactly where we want them to be so are we done no okay so obviously not but what could we do now to further improve the situation go through it again but like you don't need to check the last one anymore because we know like that number is bubbled up to the top Yeah because it has indeed bubbled all the way to the top so one and two yeah keep it as is okay two and six keep it as is okay six and three then you switch it okay we switch or swap those six and four swap it again okay so four and uh six and seven uh keep it okay seven and five swap it okay and then I think per your point we're pretty darn close let's go through once more one and two Keep It 2 three keep it 3 four keep it 4 six keep it 6 five and then switch it all right we'll switch this and now to your point we don't need to bother with the ones that already bubbled their way up now we're 100% sure it's sorted yeah and certainly the search engines of the world Google and Bing and so forth they probably don't keep web pages in sorted order because that would be a crazy long list when you're just trying to search the data but there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do and they probably similarly just like we do a bit of work upfront to get things organized even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way so that people like you and me and others can find that same information so how about social media can you Invision where the algorithms are in that world like maybe for example like Tik Tok like the for you page it's kind of like cuz those are like Rec like recommendations right it's like sort of like Netflix recommendations except more constant because it's just like every video you scroll it's like that's a new recommendation basically and it's like based on like what you've liked previously what you've like saved previously what you search up so I would assume there's some kind of algorithm there kind of figuring out like what to put on your foru page absolutely just trying to keep you presumably more engaged so the better the algorithm is the better your engagement is maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform and so forth so it all sort of feeds together together but what you're describing really is more artificially intelligent if I may because presumably there's not someone at Tik Tok or any of these social media companies saying if Patricia likes this post then show her this post if she likes this post then show her this other post because the code would sort of grow infinitely long and there's just way too much content for a programmer to be having those kinds of conditionals those those decisions being made behind the scenes so it's probably a little more artificially intelligent and in that sense You have topics like neuron networks and uh machine learning which really describe taking as input things like what you watch what you click on what your friends watch what they click on and sort of trying to infer from that instead what should we show Patricia or her friends next okay yeah yeah that makes like the distinction more makes more sense now yeah I am currently a fourth year PhD student at NYU I do robot learning so that's half and half Robotics and Mission learning sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorith so how does one actually research algorithms or invent algorithms the most important was just trying to think about inefficiencies and also think about Connecting Threads the way I think about it is that algorithm for me is not just about the way of doing something but it's about doing something efficiently learning algorithms are practically everywhere now CU Google I would say for example is learning every day about like oh what what articles with links might be better than others and reranking them um there are recommender systems all around us right like content feeds and social media or you know like YouTube or Netflix what we see is in a large part determined by this kind of learning algorithms nowadays there's a lot of concerns around some applications of machine learning and like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk and learn how you talk and even how we look and generate videos of us we're doing this for real but you could imagine a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually but how does it even know what I sound like and what I look like and how to replicate that all of this learning algorithms that we talk about right uh a lot like what goes in there is just lots and lots of data so data goes in something else comes out what comes out is whatever objective function that you optimize for like where is the line between algorithms that like play games with and without AI I think when I started off my undergrad the current AI machine learning was not very much synonymous okay and even in my undergraduate in the AI class they learned a lot of classical gorithms for game plays like for example the AAR search right that's a very simple example of how you can play a game without having anything learned this is very much oh you are at a game State you just search down see what are the possibilities and then you pick the best possibility that it can see versus what you think about when you think about I gameplay like the alpha zero for example or Alpha star or there are a lot of you know like fancy new machine learning agents that are you know even like learning very difficult games like go and those are learned agents as in they are getting better as they play more and
4,more games and as they get more games they kind of refine their strategy based on the data that they seen and once again this high level abstraction is still the same you see a lot of data and you learn from that right but the question is what is objective function that you're optimizing for is it winning this game is it forcing a tie or is it you know like opening a door in a kitchen so if the world is very much focused on supervised unsupervised reinforcement learning now like what comes next 5 10 years where's the world going I think that this is just U going to be more and more I don't want to use the word encroachment but that's what it feels like of algorithms into our everyday life like even when I was taking the train here right the trains are being routed with algorithms but this has existed for you know like 50 years probably but as I was coming here as I was checking my phone those are different algorithms and you know they're they're kind of getting all around us getting they're with us all the time they're making our life better most places most cases and I think that's just going to be continuation of all of those and it feels like they're even in places you wouldn't expect and there's just so much data about you and me and everyone else online and this data is being mind and analyzed and influencing things we see and here it would seem so there is sort of a Counterpoint which might be good for the marketers but not necessarily good for you and me as individuals you know like we're human beings but for someone we might be just a pair of eyes who are you know carrying a wallet and are there to buy things but there is so much more potential for this algorithms to just make our life better without you know like changing much about our life I'm Chris Wiggins from associate professor of Applied Mathematics at Columbia I'm also the chief data scientist of the New York Times the data science team at the New York Times develops and deploys machine learning for Newsroom and business problems but I would say the things that we do mostly you don't see but it might be things like personalization algorithm are recommending different content and do data scientists which is rather distinct from the phrase computer scientist do data scientists still think in terms of algorithms as driving a lot of it oh absolutely yeah in fact so in data science and Academia often the role of the algorithm is the optimization algorithm that helps you find the best model or the best description of a data set okay in data science and industry the goal often it's centered around an algorithm which becomes a data product right so a data scientist in Industry might be developing and deploying the algorithm which means not only understanding the algorithm and its statistical performance but also all of the software engineering around systems integration making sure that that algorithm receives input that's reliable and has output that's useful as well as I would say the organizational integration which is how does a community of people like the set of people working at the New York Times integrate that algorithm into their process interesting and I feel like AI based startups are all their R and certainly within Academia are there connections between Ai and the world of data science absolutely the algorithms that there in can you connect those dots for you're right that AI as a field has really exploded I would say particularly many people experienced a chatbot that was really really good today when people say I AI they're often thinking about large language models or they're thinking about generative AI or they might be thinking about a chatbot one thing to keep in mind is a chatbot is a special case of generative AI which is a special case of using large language models which is a special case of using machine learning generally which is what most people mean by AI you may have moments that are um what John kthy called look M No Hands results where you do some fantastic trick and you're not quite sure how it worked I think it's still very much early days large language models is still in the point of what might be called alchemy that people are building large language models without a real clear a priori sense of what the right design is for a right problem many people are trying different things out often in large companies where they can afford to have many people trying things out seeing what works publishing that instantiating it as a product and that itself is part of the scientific process I would think too yeah very much well science and engineering because often you're building a thing and the thing does something amazing to large extent we are still looking for basic theoretical results around why deep neural networks generally work why are they able to learn so well they're huge billions of parameter models and it's difficult for us to interpret how they are able to do what they do and is this a good thing do you think or an inevitable thing that we the programmers we the computer scientist the data science who are inventing these things can't actually explain how they work because I feel like friends of mine industry even when it's something simple and relatively familiar like autocomplete they can't actually tell me like why that name is appearing at the top of the list whereas years ago when these algorithms were more deterministic and more procedural you could even point to the line that made that name bubble up to the top so is this a good thing a bad thing that we're sort of losing control perhaps in some sense of the algorithm it has risks I don't know that I would say that it's good or bad but I would say there's lots of scientific precedent there are times when an algorithm works really well and we have finite understanding of why it works or a model works really well and sometimes we have very little understanding of why it works the way it does in classes I teach certainly spend a lot of time on fundamentals algorithms that have been taught in classes for decades now whether it's binary search linear search bubble swort selection sort or the like but are if we're already at the point where I can pull up chat GPT copy paste a whole bunch of numbers or words and say sort these for me does it really matter how chat GPT is sorting it does it really matter to me as the user how the software is sorting it like do the fundamentals become more dated and less important do you think now you're talking about the ways in which code and computation is a special case of Technology right so for driving a car you may not necessarily need to know much about organic chemistry even if if the organic chemistry is how the car works right so you can drive the car and use it in different ways without understanding much about the fundamentals so similarly with computation we're at a point where the computation is so high level right as you you know you can import pyit learn and you can go from zero to machine learning and 30 seconds it's depending on what level you want to understand the technology where in the stack so to speak um it's possible to understand it and make wonderful things and Advance the world without understanding it at the particular level of somebody who actually might have originally designed the actual optimization algorithm I should say though for many of the optimization algorithms there are cases where an algorithm works really well and we publish a paper and there's a proof in the paper and then years later people realize actually that prove was wrong and we're really still not sure why that optimization works but it works really well or it inspires people to make new optimization algorithms so I I do think that the the goal of understanding algorithms is Loosely coupled to our progress in advancing grade algorithms but they don't always necessarily have to require each other and for those students especially or even adults who are thinking of now steering into computer science into programming who were really jazzed about heading in that direction up until for instance November of 2022 when all of a sudden for many people it looked like the world was now changing and now maybe this isn't such a promising path this isn't such a lucrative path anymore are llms are tools like chat GPT reason not to perhaps steer into the field large language models are a particular architecture for predicting let's say the next word or a set of tokens more generally the algorithm comes in when you think about how is that llm to be trained or also how to be fine-tuned so the P of GPT is a pre-trained algorithm the idea is that you train a large language model on some Corpus of text could be encyclopedias or textbooks or what have you and then you might want to fine-tune that model around some particular task or some particular subset of texts so both of those are examples of training algorithms so I would say people's perception of artificial intelligence has really changed a lot in the last 6 months
5,particularly around November of 2022 when people experienced a really good chatbot the technology though had been around already before academics had already been working with chat gpt3 before that and GPT 2 and gpt1 and and for many people it sort of opened up this conversation about what is artificial intelligence and what could we do with this and what are the possible good and bad right like any other piece of technology cransberg first law of technology technology is neither good nor bad nor is it neutral every time we have some new technology we should think about its capabilities and the good and the possible bad as with any area of study algorithms offer a spectrum from the most basic to the most advanced and even if right now the most advanced of the those algorithms feels Out Of Reach because you just don't have that background with each lesson you learn with each algorithm you study that endgame becomes closer and closer such that it will before long be accessible to you and you will be at the end of that most advanced Spectrum
1,what's your name tell me a little bit about yourself I'm Amelia I'm nine years old I'm a third grade and my favorite subject at school is definitely science so my son is five years old and he asked me what kind of science I do and I said fusion and I said I put a star in a jar does that make sense okay that's a good answer because it sounds a little ridiculous right how can we put a star in a jar well we're not actually going to put the sun which is a star inside a jar but instead we're going to take the same kind of material that the sun is made out of and we're going to hold it for a really long time in some kind of container so Fusion is about bringing things together that's what fusing means when those Fusion reactions occur a new particle is created and energy is also released do you know what an atom is yeah all right so Adam is what everything in our world is made of and at the very center of the atom is what we call a nucleus and inside that nucleus is a proton we want to take those those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy Fusion Energy that we can use to make electricity and there's a lot of different energies and forces that we have to think about have you heard of gravity yes yes okay so that is a big important fundamental Force so another fun Force to talk about that's important for Fusion you're familiar with electricity yes right and so there's also electric forces electrostatic forces and you've heard of static electricity so now let's see about static electricity lifting my hair up I can move there's a white strand it's like hanging down the balloon took on the force from like your hair and put it in here now just like move it there you go yeah and so if we want to take those those protons and push them together to make them combine and release energy Fusion Energy that we can use to make electricity then we have to actually overcome that strong electrostatic force that just want to make those balls bounce off of each other there's another Force which you might be familiar with which is like a magnetic force we're just learning about our teacher Shield is putting one magnet on and then flipping the other one around it made it the top like kind of Bounce yeah so thinking on how to do that you know scientists are still studying exactly how magnetism works right it'll still be there for you to tackle when you become a scientist have you ever seen one of these games yes with the iron filing so if you take this and you take the magnetic end maybe you can show us what's going to happen with it while you move around those iron filings with the magnet you're totally in control of that material you're pushing you're pulling it you're moving it around and so you're using this magnetic force to also do something useful for you have you learned about the states of matter yes tell me about that so great and she put a picture on the board should you say tomorrow she shows a picture of ice a picture of water and a picture of gas did you learn that there's also a fourth state of matter no when you heat up a gas you create a plasma a plasma is the fourth state of matter the plasma I study is actually invisible I think we heard science yes and the plasmas I work with are so hot that I can't see with my eyes but it's light that I can measure it with very very special instruments let's play music how do you keep the invisible plasmas yes or invisibility keep them in one spot so you can show where they are yes we absolutely do we hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields so you didn't have to actually touch the iron filings in the toy to move them around you could pass the magnetic field through the plastic and control them with it so it's the same thing we don't have to touch this very very hot plasma to control it and hold it in place because we use magnetic fields you are so smart I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject
2,what is student energy the way our sun generates energy is by Fusion reactions it fuses hydrogen the lightest element we know about into helium and that gets fused into heavier and heavier elements so here on Earth we're going to take some special kinds of hydrogen a special flavor of it if you will which we call an isotope and we're going to combine them to create new particles and we can only get that combination of particles to happen if they are in a plasma what's your favorite exhibit the science museum I love the lightning show like okay so cool you probably have learned in school about three states of matter the solid liquid and gas absolutely we take the gas and we add heat and we get a plasma and a plasma is a state of matter where you have an ionized gas if we break down that gas if we add enough energy to ionize it we can take the electrons and the ions and the atom and separate them and now there's this soup of charged particles that are moving around that's the plasma and it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning so you've already seen a plasma in fact so I'm going to show you this fun demonstration you've probably seen one of these before right oh that's so cool yeah so the way this is happening is this glass ball here is a container for our plasma and we've taken most of the air out of the container so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball and very very low temperature plasma so it's continuously ionizing and then recombining and becoming neutral again and we see those energy transitions as the visible light so if we're going to put this plasma to use and do something helpful with it like maybe make some clean electricity we would have to control it yeah and another word for controlling it is confining it so let me let me turn this off and set it back down you're probably wondering what is this thing on this table it's a model of a Tokamak and that's the name of the device that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy have you played with magnets in school okay we've learned about the how it has to be a positive positive and negative charge and we've done those things you can like put them with something in between them and just move one and the other will always follow this is all very important to sort of understand how we would create a container that would let us hold the plasma in place and control it have you ever played around with an electromagnet in class it's a coil of wire much like this big red coil of wire right here and when we push an electrical current through this wire it creates a magnetic field that goes around the wire perpendicular so if you want to know the direction of the magnetic seal that's been created by pushing the current Through the Wire put your thumb in the direction of the current and then curl your fingers like this yeah and that's the right hand rule so if we push the current this way we're creating a magnetic field in this perpendicular Direction so if I drive a current and this red wire like this which direction will the magnetic field go yeah exactly perpendicular and if I drive the current in this green wire which direction will it go exactly yeah the Long Way perpendicular now this is a bit of a trickier one the blue wire is going to act like a transformer action and so by changing the current in the blue coil we are going to be able to run a current in this direction around the Tokamak and now think back to how the wires worked if I have a current going like this where's the magnetic field exactly back this way the short way around the tokoak we can now put together the pieces and understand the three magnetic fields that we need to confine a plasma in our Tokamak so our plasma will be inside this vessel in the shape of a donut what could the tocamak be used for in like real life oh Supple address so what we want to use the Toca mic for in realize is to confine this super hot plasma and we're talking a hundred million 150 million degrees because the plasma is so very hot the particles have enough energy to interact with one another and fuse when those Fusion reactions occur we are releasing energy that's inside the nucleus and we can harness that energy to make clean electricity
3,so what have you heard about Fusion already before today the impeding joke is that you know we've looked forward to Fusion for a long time but you're not exactly gone in there yet but if we do ever get there it would solve a lot of our energy problems in a dramatic way do you have any idea about any of the challenges like why has it taken us so long to get to Fusion making a star honor at this thought easy so we are trying to bring a starter works we are not going to be using hydrogen the way our star in our solar system our sun uses hydrogen to make helium and generates Fusion Energy that way instead on Earth we're going to be using isotopes of hydrogen deuterium and tritium what do you know about charged particles if I want to try and push too positively charge particles together two protons together what do you think is going to happen they repulse each other and they don't like being close together so they push back on that we're gonna call the pushback is a coulomb interaction or coulomb Collision so you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron and a Triton and so those are the positively charged ions of deuterium and tritium and I try and combine them together those two positively charged particles just sort of bounce off of each other so we have to give them enormous amounts of energy and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures so we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius and we typically put that into an energy unit that we use a lot in plasma physics called an electron volt and so we describe being up at 100 million degrees that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts that's very very hot temperature but the other thing we need is a lot of particles that's the density we are able to combine a deuteron and a Triton in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures at lower energies than other fuel this has to do with some very nice properties of the deuteron and the Triton that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse there's actually a resonance which is predicted by quantum mechanics and that really helps have a little bump up in the cross section for the deuterium tritium fusion reaction compared to just hydrogen yes exactly exactly how that little bump up is good for us because it means that we have a higher probability of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse than otherwise at those manageable temperatures and when we say manageable for Fusion scientists yeah 50 million 100 million 150 million Celsius so the problem you described is that we get to those high temperatures we have dense plasma but the problem is the hotter the plasma is the more likely it is the heat to get sucked out of it by absolutely yeah absolutely glad that solved is not saying staying hot enough for the time we needed to stay we've come so far in the study of magnetically confined plasmas which is which is what I work on that we sort of tamed all the other types of major instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma so you might be asking yourself what is the energy that's coming out of the fusion reaction so we've got the deuteron and we've got the Triton and so they combine an effusion reaction and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus but the neutron doesn't have any charge yes it comes out exactly so it comes right out and it's the kinetic energy of the neutron and we want it to interact with our overall Energy System and as it interacts with that material it heats the material up it transfers is its kinetic energy to this material take that thermal energy and run a turbine run a generator and convert it into electricity so once you get to that stage it starts to look a lot like any other thermal power plant whether it's fission or natural gas so a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core coming in setting it in place and driving your thermal system to make electricity we often call it an alpha particle and that is a charged particle right so it's actually going to stay in the plasma it's an energetic particle compared to the fuel so it actually is going to give its kinetic energy back to the fuel via coulomb collisions cool so now they're good now we like them so you get this kind of self-sustaining it's like yes you said exactly the right word self-sustaining
4,I am in soft condensed matter physics and my research kind of dips into Material Science but I feel like people are always asking me about Fusion what are they asking you about Fusion so usually people ask me like do you think that we'll ever really replace all of our other energy sources with Fusion I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it because the fuel for Fusion is a plasma and we don't experience plasmas on Earth in our everyday life they exist in space at the Event Horizon of a black hole and the solar wind in our sun or very rapid events like lightning is also sort of a weakly ionized plasma even among plasmas there are so many different kinds of plasmas there are low temperature higher density plasmas there are of course the astrophysical plasmas and space plasmas and then there are Fusion plasmas they are predominantly fully ionized size plasmas they are also plasmas where we have a certain ability to basically kick up micro instabilities so they're plasmas which are held in a stable enough state by strong external magnetic fields confining the plasma into a donut shape and this has a lot of advantages for us because charged particles want to follow the magnetic field lines but things start to get really interesting when we're no longer thinking about individual particle motions in the plasma and instead we start to think about Collective effects it's never occupied any space in my mind to think about what happens when you have something so high temperature and like precisely confined and now you have to deal with presumably turbulence plus magnetic fields when we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma we can no longer even think about the plasma as a single fluid instead we have to consider electron fluid and ion fluid separately we have to use our full-blown kinetic equation to explain how this state of matter is behaving because we have collisions so we have to add collisions back in to understand and track how all the particles are moving and how these Collective motions as turbulence can get kicked up so that's pretty intractable uh yeah right I mean if people talk about stimulating that system and following those particles it's probably going to take millions and millions of years on even the fastest supercomputer so one really big advance in plasma Theory over the last I'd say three or four decades has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory that we use to model the microtubulence in the plasma and get that under control and the reason it's so important to get the turbulence under control and understand it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold across confining field lines in a magnetic confinement system being able to study it measure it and predict how it's going to behave is really one of the big hurdles to to overcome could you say the name of the model again absolutely so it's a gyrokinetic model and we talked about how challenged it would be to follow every particle in space and know its position and know its velocity at all times so what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop a Charged particle into a strong external magnetic field the Lorenz Force bends that particle's trajectory into a helix and so now if we know that wherever the field line is going that particle is following it in this helical in this Corkscrew trajectory we can say aha I no longer have to worry about following that particle's velocity around in a circle because at every point in time I know it's going in a circle okay so we average that out we do a row average because the motion is typically called a gyro frequency that's how fast it goes around the field line and it has a particular radius of that Helix called the gyro radius because it's just gyrating so what we know from studying the plasma and making direct measurements of the turbulence and also what comes from the simulations is the scale size of the turbulence is about 5 to 10 gyro radii use of the density and temperature fluctuations are what Drive these uh these turbulent flows that end up reducing your your heat transport is there anything that can be done to minimize the density and heat fluctuations or is that just like down to the statistics of things I love the way you framed it because originally like in the 60s and 70s people did not think that microtubulence would even be a problem but as we started to make more and more measurements and build higher and higher basically performing devices we started to see nothing is matching the expected performance and that's because people thought that coulomb collisions between the particles just interactions of charged particles would dominate Cross Field transport right what happens with turbulence is it enhances the transport of particles because now we're not just talking about this random walk of collisions we're talking about conduction convection deities structures microstructures flow generation very complex soup of activity turbulence for me like really hits on one of the most beautiful Parts about physics like it's so complex and that's what makes it like visually beautiful that's what makes it mathematically interesting and it's also what keeps us so puzzled about it yeah turbulence is beautiful and so fun to study
5,I'm a research scientist at MIT and I work on computational plasma physics basically doing simulations that can accurately describe what's going on inside these Fusion reactors like tokamax and distillerators they have plasmas that are magnetically confined so we're trying to predict how the plasma behaves so that we can build in the future better reactors what's one of the most exciting parts of your research right now something that we were not able to do until very recently was actually using first principle simulations to predict the performance and efficiency of reactors the developments in plasma Theory and computation and simulation and that has been thoroughly validated over the years in many experiments that now we're using those simulations to inform how to best operate our future reactors very exciting because so far we've been getting great results it's very very promising we're going with a lot of the experiments right now is trying to produce some maybe outside the box data sets that we haven't seen before and then of course ultimately compare them to the simulations and do a bit of this validation maybe where we're not just looking under the lamp post where we're going a little bit outside the comfort zone that means going from measurements really sort of more in the middle of the plasma at about mid-radius pushing all the way out to the edge where the turbulence starts to become very different in its nature it becomes a lot more electromagnetic it becomes sometimes larger in scale just physical scale size and some of the things we're starting to find was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas don't always behave the way we think they do so as we think about pushing our measurements and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge how does that influence what you're working on now the edge of the plasmic gives you the boundary condition really for the simulations that then we do in the chord you need to start somewhere determining what is the temperature very close to the wall really the machine and when you get that temperature then you can actually integrate inwards with the rest of core model it's going to be very exciting the next years when we can actually make some measurements in those devices and compare them to simulations so that we can have more trust in the predictions for the next step for the reactors the power plants maybe both of us in our own way answer the question that we always get asked when is Fusion gonna happen when are we going to have Fusion electricity on the grids it's hard to say when it's gonna arrive I think that with the arrival of private companies and Venture Capital um that is accelerating things a lot so I don't think Fusion is 30 years away and it will always be I don't think that's true anymore so you're saying lots of private companies have have entered and that's injected a lot of private funding not just Government funding oh yeah the nature of the private Ventures is you know you want to get commercial as soon as possible so I think they're accelerating things they are actually taking um advantages of discoveries in other fields like in the case of um High field fusion with Commonwealth Fusion systems and to come back energy those companies they are using high temperature superconductors it's an advancement that has come recently from material sign right or machine learning activity telling you those breakthroughs in other fields I think can really accelerate Fusion so I think we're seeing the next decades are going to be very exciting we have to diversify the different research that we do so that at the end we come with the most Optimum solution for our fusion power plants I agree yeah I think having multiple stakeholders who are all driven by different missions and different purposes working synergistically is exciting when I'm asked like okay what's the timeline for fusion and why is now any different than five years ago or ten years ago why is now the Walmart for Fusion my answer is it's finally for the first time all the pieces of the puzzle are here we've Advanced really the basic physics understanding so far that we have got the predictive capabilities but we also have uh alignment with policy and science drivers that we didn't really have before that's I think what can get us there maybe a demonstration of net electricity in a decade is that the thing folks are pushing for we're pushing for it yeah there are challenges still to overcome us you know and hopefully we find solutions to those when we have new experiments and when we actually push forward yeah the potential is huge
1,old are you Kayla I am nine years old so if you're nine years old what does that mean about the Earth how many times has it gone around the Sun nine times nine times so there's a relationship between motion through space the Earth is going through space and the passage of time they're kind of connected in some way but there are differences right if I asked you to move through space you could do it freely right can you get up and let's see how easy it is to move through space can you move over to that location and can you come back anything getting in your way easy to do yep if I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space can you do that I mean hold perfectly still that's good but if I ask you to hold still in time to not go to the next second or the next second can you do that no so there's definitely this difference between space and time some fundamental quality that distinguishes how freely we can move through space versus how freely we can move through time have you heard of Albert Einstein yes what do you know about him yes please here and I think I may be heading in that direction actually he showed us an approach to travel to the Future you want me to tell you how you do it you build a spaceship you go out into space really quickly you turn around and you come back to planet Earth and he showed us that when you're on that ship your clock will tick off time more slowly you will age more slowly so that Journey may only take you say a year six months out and six months back but you know what when you step out of the ship it'll be a hundred years into the future or a thousand years a million years into the future would you do that if you could I would probably be dead by that no you'd be alive that's the amazing thing I'd be to everybody else would be dead who stayed on Earth but your body would only age one year and yet it would be a thousand years into the future the question though is could you get back and I don't know the answer to that nobody does we don't know if you can travel back but we certainly know that you can travel forward has anyone ever tried to go forward and back I don't think so that same guy with the crazy hair Albert Einstein showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go and you know what the limit is the limit is the speed light because light travels 671 million miles per hour that is fast enough to go around the entire Earth seven times in one second so if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light we'd be able to do what Einstein noted there's something else that's really curious about time things tend to go in One Direction and we call it the arrow of time it sort of points from the past into what we call the future if you'd ask me why is there an arrow to time ask me why is there an error at the time I'm not really sure I have some ideas but I'd say we've still not completely nailed it down Kayla what have you learned about time from talking about it here that you can't really travel back through time and can you travel to the Future in Prince maybe maybe that's absolutely right I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past but it's not been ruled out that's kind of exciting that it's still
2,if I was to ask you what is time what would you say time is kind of strange because it's almost a man-made idea there is the tangible of you know how the Earth revolves around the Sun or how we orbit around ourselves it's almost in a way does it exist if the way that we measure it is man-made before there's any life on planet Earth I think we all agree the universe existed did things change before there was life on Earth yes and how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time it's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it even if it is a human-made concept that the Universe evolved developed changed Through Time ultimately giving rise to Galaxy stars planets and on this particular Planet life that conception of time gives it feel that it's like Universal that it's out there it's the same for everybody it's independent of our actions or activities do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time he found that if you and I say have identical wrist watches I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock you know it's really remarkable you can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact that the speed of light is constant have you ever heard that phrase my freshman year physics class yeah if you're clever you can use that with high school algebra maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier to derive that clocks take off time at different rate do you want me to show you how that goes yes please right so to figure out the effect of motion on time I'm going to use a really simple clock it's called a light clock it's two mirrors that are facing each other and what we do is we have a little ball of light called a photon right that goes up hits the top mirror then comes back down and hits the bottom mirror and every time it does that you go Tick Tock that's one unit of time imagine now we have another one of these light clocks but I'm going to have it in motion now what do you notice about that path it's much longer it's much longer right this one's going tick tock tick this is going to go tick tick tock in fact we can figure out the ratio let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock well that ratio is going to be the ratio of the lengths then this would be given by D over L more time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock well this length over here that's the same as this L over here right so we want D over L now you may have recalled that in trigonometry there's a name for L over d sine of theta opposite is l hypotenuse is d right and so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta so if we can figure out 1 over sine Theta we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time on the stationary clock to time on the moving clock we just need one other fact the speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C C equals speed of light but in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror the component of the speed of light in the horizontal Direction better be keeping perfect Pace with the speed of the clock itself so let's assume that this clock is moving in this Direction with the speed equal to V so c times cosine Theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion and from this we learn that cosine Theta is equal to V over C there's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry that sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta is equal to one this is really just a Pythagorean theorem in Disguise and from that we can now solve for sine squared theta equals 1 minus V over c squared and if for sine Theta is the square root of this and now we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine Theta which now is 1 over square root of 1 minus V over C squared so you see as V gets very close to C this gets very close to one one minus something very close to one is very close to zero one over something close to zero is huge which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time the moving that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light now I did this for a light clock but it's true for any clock and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity do you think that in the near or foreseeable future of humans as we know ourselves now will there be a time where we are using these formulas and these Concepts in our daily lives as technology progresses the barrier between the limitations of experience and the truth of how the world behaves in extreme environments will be moved in the very same way that you know we can toss a pack of gum and we know where to put our other hand to catch it well we have that kind of intuition about these ideas I think it's quite possible
3,what are you studying right now I'm doing physics and computer science so have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward and time and backward in time is that something you're familiar with yeah and the one thing that really confuses me there I'm thinking about uh one of the most basic things we learn I guess from Interstellar is that the universe is expanding or space is expanding and so I'm thinking how does that square with gravity and electromagnetism which is like kind of predicated on the density of charges or masses the fact that space expands is perfectly compatible with our understanding of all the forces of nature because all of them continue to operate in a somewhat more subtle way but we have a beautiful prescription for taking any law that we understand in the simpler context a flat space time and juicing it up so that it works in a curved space-time the more philosophical question is in any of those formulations if you replace T by minus t and you do it properly in the equations the equations still work but if past and future are kind of treated on equal footing in the fundamental equations why are they so different from the perspective of experience when you're talking about the perspective experience could you is that just human subjective experience or actual observation for physics well certainly it starts with human subjective experience but then we are able to elevate it to a more objective description for instance when we introduce words like disorder and order an entropy in the second law of Thermodynamics and the equation usually the way we say it is s equals K log W entropy equals boltzmann constant times log of a particular quantity which is ultimately counting the number of distinct configurations that A system can be in what boltzmann and others showed is that entropy tends to increase toward the future but the key word there is tends to increase so this Arrow of time going from the past to the Future rests on a curious Foundation it's a statistical Foundation which says that it's more likely for eggs to Splatter than unsplatter it's more likely for glasses to smash than unsmash but not that it's impossible for those things to happen you just have to wait a really long time for there to be a reasonable chance of it ever taking place when you said that um you know it's more likely for an egg to smash or for glass to smash and that's probably because there's so many atoms so much stuff going on yes but I'm thinking if we zoom in on like a single thing I guess do we have variations that are extremely unintuitive because you know things can happen in a way that isn't a statistical average if I take a film of that electron it's a little fanciful to describe it that language because you know about quantum mechanics and so forth but I take a film of a little particle moving around and I show you that film you'll be really hard-pressed to determine whether I've shown you the film running forward in time or whether I've shown you the film going in reverse time if I had two or three or four or a gazillion particles into the mix then it will be much easier for you to determine whether the film is going forward in time or backward in time but order and disorder don't have much meaning if there's only one particle and that's why the fundamental laws don't draw a distinction but the macroscopic experience does but it raises a key question where'd the order of the egg come from if everything goes toward disorder how do I get this orderly collection of atoms called an egg well you probably would say from a chicken but then I say to you where'd the chicken come from and you say from an egg but there's actually some real insight we can draw from this because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of Life we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the Galaxy and ultimately the universe each step taking us to greater and greater order so we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself highly ordered beginning called the bank and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since we still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was high highly ordered at the moment it's really a deep assumption Einstein we wondered does time change with speed and that's another change with that before we didn't think possible but I guess we found out eventually some of the fanciful ideas I guess there's a tiny sliver of Hope yeah not only did we find that time changes with speed and special relativity but we also found that time changes with gravity Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field or gravitational potential actually that it is experiencing I think you mentioned Interstellar before do you remember the scene in interstellar they're going to a planet that's near a black hole they go down to the planet and they spend just a couple hours there but when they go back to the ship it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field comparatively quickly far away and that's not science fiction that's actually how time behaves I've always heard people say oh general relativity you know it might not seem applicable but you know GPS due to satellites yeah we could synchronize those Clocks by accounting for relativity well but that's even a really really good point the GPS would become completely inaccurate in a very short period of time if the satellites weren't taking account of or the software wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses differently for the clocks on the satellite compared to the clocks down here on Earth so we walk around with
4,the galaxy are moving based on what they're made of which is interesting clearly time comes in to what you're doing to what extent do you have to Grapple with some of the subtle features yeah with my research in particular I really want to know what happened in the past and what happened in the future but you only get a single snapshot when you look up at the night sky right but if it's officially far back you're right and so we can learn a lot by looking at other galaxies and seeing what they were doing in in their present I suppose yeah just figuring out what's gonna happen next is is part of part of the issue yeah that's looking into the future I suppose and so have you taken general relativity are you taking that now or I took a course on general relativity yeah but you learned about black holes sure one of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels if you will shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space but once you have a shortcut from here to there the beautiful thing is if you move the openings time will elapse differently at the different openings so there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines go One Direction you're going into the future go the other direction you'd be going into the past but that of course raises philosophical and logical Paradox paradoxism sort so what do you think what do you I throw it to you yeah I've heard a few different theories that people pause it maybe it is Back to the Future and you really change your own Universe I've also heard people say that you could have a multiple universes Spawn from this event or something yeah that's that's if you're going to be able to change the past that's the one that resonates most with me I think the same yeah so you go into the past and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting but you're preventing them from meeting in a parallel reality which means that you will never be born in that reality but the origin of your birth is still completely understood it was in the universe from which you originated another one that's more subtle is the laws of physics May prevent you from interceding right and that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will I'm immediately uncomfortable yeah so that one there's actually some people like Joe who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole and in that way if it could knock it of course we seem to be in some logical Paradox absolutely but the finding was the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening and the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one Universe not parallel universes like in the other solution moments in time just are they don't change the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen so if you have the atoms of time the individual events there's no conception of them changing so whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment do you think travel back to the past is impossible because of a deep physical like mathematical reasoning or just because of all of these problems that you've been talking about I suspect that when we fully understand the mathematics of the final physical laws if we ever come upon them I think there's going to be something built in okay that prevents this kind of free travel to the past but sometimes I I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from this kind of paradoxes so what pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical proposals for traveling to the past that have come out of physics you can't travel to a moment in the past before the first time travel machine is built sure you know the twin paradox yeah sure where you know you fly off looks like you're moving fast but to you it looks like the other guy is moving fast so who actually ages more who ages less yeah a resolution I've heard is that because you have to be going away and then coming back you had to accelerate at some point and this breaks the the ambiguity yeah what if say the universe isn't flat what if the universe is curved and you go off in One Direction and then you come back in the same direction you pass by the Earth who's older then yeah do we have an answer yeah we do have an answer so the simplest version of that is imagine that the Universe has a shape of a donut imagine I'm on the circular part of this donut Universe all right and imagine I turn on two laser beams sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left and these beams will go around the entire entirety of space and will both come back and at some point they will hit me imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference say to my left they do the same experiment they fire the beam of light left and right notice that the beam that they fired to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense they're moving toward it the two beams of light will not hit that moving Observer at the same moment to you or to them to them wow which means that there's a preferred frame of reference in this universe everybody is not on equal footing as they are when we teach to freshmen the special theory of relativity that's right exactly no everybody else is moving relative to me and it's real emotion so everybody else will be like the moving twin they will be younger and I will be older and when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe the fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between to that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker I rage against thinking like that yeah I think that's the perfect way to put it yeah because it might be a brief flicker on a single moat of dust like floating in a cosmic eternity yeah but it's everything yeah there's nothing else that I'll ever experience and so in a way there's there's nothing else to me yeah there's an eternity but I'm never gonna see it I'm never gonna feel it it can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing or none of what we do sort of persists on the other hand if you flip your perspective around and say how remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate wow how wonderful is that yeah
5,idea of what time is I'm fond of saying look space is the language that allows us to say where events take place and time is the language that allows us to specify when they take place where would you jump off from there and trying to give a deeper understanding of the basics of time maybe part of the distinction in between time and space it's that you have a clear irreversible Evolution so how to explain what time is well it's a parameter that is measured by clocks I mean at the end this is what we know and allows us to talk about change and also that we know how to describe in terms of some set of equations which gives a clear sense of causality to note our recent paper where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity but in a setting where the global shape of the space-time if you imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space a circular Dimension and thought about how special relativity Works in that setting we came to result in this very basic setting you can send signals into the past not in a way that will violate causality did that surprise you that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space but making that one change you could have this radical impact I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of a signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple totally classical there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified was identified on a circle actually even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time and the beauty of it is it's not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results and they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality we discovered that a fast moving Observer that could be us on a rock it could send signals verifier and then back in a very small time so the old idea that of course we always hear about that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life they're far away we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello and then like 10 000 years or a hundred thousand years later they'll answer us because it'll take that long for the signals but at least in this setup which we don't know is true of our universe but if it were then you could have a real time Conversation Over arbitrarily large distances yes which is that was unexpected yeah and so that shows how even ideas that seem to be well settled and well understood have surprises like why didn't Einstein realize this yes yeah maybe the idea of living on a Subspace or being confined in this extra dimension on a Surface may have been looked exotic but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s many people have begun thinking about the possibility that space and time may be so-called emergent quantities that they're not as fundamental as perhaps Newton or Einstein would have thought where do you stand on that idea it seems not Unthinkable saying that something is emergent will make full sense only when we have some concrete model in which space and time emerging in which we make sense of this non-space non-time description of a theory I don't know if we are still at this stage in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario because often I tell my students the greatest scientific revolution has been not in the 20th century it has not been quantum mechanics nor general relativity no special relativity it has been the passage from the qualitative description of nature to quantitative one when you pass from asking how to how much right then you understand something and who do you credit with as that Newton do you go a little bit below I would say Galileo Newton of course the the completion of this idea is Newton one of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists that if someone's moving relative to me what they consider now might be in my past what they consider now might be in my future which would suggest that all of time exists much says we're willing to accept that all of space exists does that hold water actually it resonates with me for various reasons one is that professionally we use space-time diagrams Penrose diagrams a lot of diagrams where space and times are just two axis on a board and when we describe a particle we have a line that goes up in time by the way this image also is the last image improves the last page there is this beautiful sentence which is also true saying that if he has the time he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extend in time much longer than in space if it's equal to one that's very true so this idea that you have a Continuum and the time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone it's very practical it's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics when in the approach of various people including heart or collaborated a lot with Hawking there is this idea that what you describe is a history it's not a particular moment in time but it's an evolution this history treats space and time on a more equal basis but would you say there's more to it than the technical more to it than the diagrams more to it than sort of an interpretation of the mathematical equations when you go so far as the text solace in the fact that that in a sense that you will always exist because you will always be at the moments of space and time that you have occupied throughout your life well actually that's probably the only way in which you can take solace because all the rest right it's almost children's stories yeah I mean of course it's something that you come by yourself you arrive at this conclusion which is totally not objective and is part of your personal history by yourself but it was interesting to see that for instance Kurt Vonnegut had exactly the same thing I said no I mean the only thing that really makes you not fear what will happen or your own is that every instant is eternal instances exactly as each point in space it's not the space disappears it will always be there yeah the idea that something is irretrievable maybe it's an accident and we go back again to order the initial conditions in which we started absolutely
1,so what do you know about Infinity I think it means that it's something that's infinite that never ends that's a great way to think about it Infinity is something that never ends we're finite the opposite of infinity refers to a process or a quantity that we could actually count all the way through at least in theory if given enough time so if you had to guess how many Skittles are in this jar I would say about like 217. 217. and if we wanted to figure out the exact number how would we find out we could like put them along divide them into pieces of five and then we could use that yeah absolutely in fact I did that before you got here and it's uh 649 Skittles here's a much harder question how many pieces of glitter do you think are in that jar maybe like 4012 I'll admit I have absolutely no idea do you think it's a finite number or an infinite number finite because I can see them all in here yeah you can see them all and in fact if we were really really really patient we could do the same thing with this as with the Skittles but here's another question you said that there's a finite amount of glitter in that jar and I agree so how many jars would we need to hold an infinite amount of glitter and then if you're amount of jars very good why do you say that because if there's unlimited pieces of glitter we need unlimited pieces of Jar so let's try and imagine infinitely many jars would they fit in this room yeah no yeah absolutely not because this room holds only a finite amount of space and in fact infinitely many jars would not even fit in something called the observable universe which is the uh portion of the universe that astronomers can see really how does that make you feel I actually feel like my brain is exploding that makes me feel like my brain is that's a wonderful question a very rich question what do you think I think maybe because as you said it was unlimited you have very good intuition so there are ways that mathematicians can build infinite collections of things and if you repeat those processes it's in fact possible to build even bigger and bigger sizes of infinity so what have you learned today about Infinity I've learned that even if it's unlimited there are many different ways of making infinity and you can never actually see
2,what does infinity mean to you really anything that has no end to it yeah that's absolutely right so Infinity gets used a lot of different ways in mathematics there's a way that mathematicians think of infinity as a number just like the number 13 just like the number 10 million so wow okay so the reason that mathematicians consider Infinity to be a number is that it is a size of a set so the first example of an infinite set in mathematics is the set of all county numbers so one two three four five six seven Etc that list goes on forever that is an infinite set and to be a little bit more precise it's a countably infinite set but as a number infinity is pretty strange like what do you mean by that adding Infinities multiplying Infinities and there's a sense in which it's very similar to the arithmetic that you learned about already but it's also totally different it has some very weird properties welcome to Hilbert's Hotel unlike in order ordinary hotel has countably infinitely many rooms suppose a new guest shows up you might think that the new guest could take the room that's all the way down at the end of the hall all the way except there isn't a room like that the rooms each have a number and even though there's infinitely many rooms each room is only a finite distance away so here's how we're going to make room for the new guest I'm going to ask the guest in room one to move into room two and then we're going to ask the guest in room two to move into room three and we'll continue this all the way along it looks to me like there's space for the new guest where is it it'll be room number one room number one exactly I'm going to use this symbol for infinity but what we've just shown is that one the one new guest plus infinity is equal to the same Infinity what happens if we add a second guest would it be two plus infinity equals infinity absolutely okay so now I'm going to make this story a little more complex but there's another Hilbert's Hotel down the street and they're having plumbing issues and we need to find room for them okay they can't live together they can't live here that would be a great solution I don't know I think these people don't really get along so I need to somehow create infinitely many new rooms but I can only ask each person in the hotel to move a finite distance away right so let's take the guest who is originally in room one and move them into room two so that's creating one new space for us and now I'm going to take the guest who was originally in room two and move them into room four are you starting to see a pattern here yes you're going up one each time yeah I'm increasing by one more each time so I'm doubling the room number right so this is some of the strange arithmetic of infinity so we have two Hilbert hotels Each of which have infinitely many guests right then this is equal to infinity infinity great Hilbert's hotel is a story that mathematicians have been telling themselves for almost 100 years because it's a really visceral way to think about some of the counter-intuitive properties of the arithmetic of infinity how does Infinity come across in mathematics for you so when I'm teaching calculus and talking about Concepts like limits and derivatives those are only defined precisely with infinity teaching algebra which is meant in a different sense about number systems we deal with infinite families of numbers and their operations infinite sets are somehow very exotic they're not found so commonly in the real world but they're all over mathematics
3,what do you know about Infinity a property of something being endless great so today we're going to focus on Infinity as a cardinality and what cardinality means is it's a size of a set what are you studying I'm studying computer science studying computer science are you taking any math courses right now yeah right now I'm taking calculus 2. calculus involves the study of functions functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics but they aren't always so clearly defined what would you say a function is I would say a function is a procedure that takes an input and does some operation and returns an output that's the computer science brain thinking right there so we want to think of a function as a procedure or a mapping between sets so a function defines a one-to-one correspondence if it defines a perfect matching between the elements of its domain set and the elements of its output set we call such functions by ejections or isomorphisms so the reason I'm so interested in this idea of a bijective function or a one-to-one correspondence that guarantees that every element of one set gets matched with an element of the other set no matter how many elements there are these bijections or these one-to-one correspondences as they help mathematicians reason about Infinity how can you compare something that is endless today we're going to think about Infinity as a cardinality which is a technical term for a number that could be a size of a and we're going to use this idea of one-to-one Correspondence to try and investigate the question of whether all infinite sets have the same size so what I've drawn here are some pictures of some of the infinite sets that appear in mathematics so the natural numbers are the prototypical example of an infinite set so the natural numbers are clearly a subset of the integers both of these are infinite sets are they the same size infinity or different size Infinities I guess the integers would there'd be more integers than natural numbers I'm going to now try and convince you that there are in fact the same size infinity and this is using this idea of a one-to-one correspondence which was applied in this context by Georg Cantor what he says is if we can match up the elements of the integers with the elements of the natural numbers so that there's nothing left over so that there's a bijective function between them then that's a proof that there's exactly as many natural numbers as there are integers start by matching zero with zero and one with one but then we want to include the negatives in the list so which natural number would we match with negative one maybe two maybe two why not because now we're starting to make progress on matching all the negatives we can match the natural number three with the integer two the natural number four with the integer minus two and do you see a pattern all of the positive integers would be odd numbers and all the negative integers would be even numbers great so now I have a much harder question so we have the same challenge again evidently there are way way way more rational numbers than there are integers does that mean there's a this is a larger infinite set than the integers what do you think by intuition I would say yes but that was the same case with the integers I would imagine there might be some bijective function for mapping natural numbers to rational numbers so I'm going to use this picture to count the rational numbers by actually counting the elements of this larger set because it'll be clearer geometrically what I've drawn in this picture is the integer lattice so Z Cross C refers to the set of all of these dots so I'll start by counting the number at the origin and you can see I'm just labeling the dots around the origin moving in a counterclockwise fashion and getting progressively further away and this process could continue but maybe by now you see the pattern that would be a little bit difficult to describe as a function oh is it for each rational number there's a pair of natural or integers that represent that rational number yeah that's exactly right and now for each pair of integers I'm going to represent it by a corresponding natural number that's what's going on with this counting and when I compose those operations what I've done is I've encoded rational numbers as natural numbers in a way that reveals that they can be no larger there are no more rational numbers than natural numbers so this slope is represented by 3 2 and 3 2 is in here as 25. exactly so that's exactly right so we were hoping to compare the size of Infinity of the rational numbers with the size of Infinity of the natural numbers so what we've done is introduced an intermediate set these pair of integer points and this proves that this size of infinity is smaller than the size of infinity since we also have an injective function the other way this size of infinity is smaller than this size of infinity so therefore they must be the same size that's wild now there's one final collection of numbers that we haven't yet discussed which are the real numbers all of the points on the number line do you think that's the same size Infinity I guess again intuition seems like it must be much larger but I don't know I haven't been on a roll Dior Cantor proved that it is impossible to count all real numbers like we've just counted the rational numbers or just counted the integers this is called the cardinality of the Continuum is uncountable what I'm going to do now is form a new real number that I guarantee is not on this list okay so here's how we do this what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at the diagonal elements so I'll highlight them this continues forever and now I'm going to form a new real number by changing all of these so if you just like added one to them then that would be something that doesn't exist in any of the other ones yes you see the idea right away so I'm going to form a new real number whose first digit is different from this one and you've already convinced yourself that this number is not on this list anywhere why is that because at every Point there's at least one change from a number in there great that's exactly right so what we've proven is that this number is missing and therefore it is impossible to define a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers so we've started to explore some of the counter-intuitive properties of Infinity on the one hand there are infinite sets that feel very different like the natural numbers the integers the rational numbers that nevertheless have the same size or the same infinite cardinality well there are other infinities that are larger so there's more than one size of infinity not all infinities are created equal I was wondering what the kind of practical implications are what you can do with this sort of knowledge really glad you asked me that there's a practical implication for computer science Alan Turing he came up with a mathematical model of a computer something called a Terrain machine so Turin was wondering is it possible to compute every real number an arbitrary real number to within arbitrary Precision in finite time he defined a real number to be computable if you could calculate its value maybe not exactly but as accurately as you'd like in a finite amount of time and because there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers but only countably infinitely many terrain machines what that means is that the vast majority of real numbers are uncomputable so we'll never be able to access them with a computer program
4,you're a PhD student is that right yes I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Maryland does Infinity come up in your mathematics that you're studying one place Infinity comes up is in algebraic geometry normally we think okay well if you have two lines like this you'd keep drawing them well the intersite right here but in projective space two parallel lines will also intersect at the point at infinity infinity is like this perfect concept for what we can add to a space that allows lines to have this more uniform property what's your research in so one of my main research areas is something called category Theory that's been described as the mathematics of mathematics it's a language that can be used to prove very general theorems and an interesting aspect of being a researcher in category theory that doesn't come up as much in other areas is that we have to really pay attention to the axioms of set theory in our work when you're approving theorems have you ever used the Axiom of choice yeah it's basically this idea that you can put a choice function on any set and a choice function does what exactly yeah that's a good question so the way I think about it is if you have an infinite or an arbitrary family of sets and you know for sure that none of these sets are empty then a choice function would allow you to select an element from each set sort of all at once when you've used the Axiom of choice in proofs you know which incarnation of this you've used yeah I've used it like that I've also used it in Zorn Zama and in the well ordering principle so there are three well-known famous equivalent forms of the axing of choice the well-ordering principle is the Assumption the Axiom that any set can be well ordered but there are lots of subsets of real numbers that do not have a minimal element so that ordering is not a well ordering so here's the key question do you believe the Axiom of choice I do believe The Accidental choice you do believe the eczema choice though it leads us to some strange conclusions so if the Axiom choice is true then it's necessarily the case that there exists a well ordering of the real and what that means is that we can perform induction over real numbers like we perform induction over the natural numbers this is trans-finite induction it would work for any ordinal so there must be some uncountably infinite ordinal that represents the order type of the real numbers and this allows us to prove some crazy things imagine three-dimensional euclidean space so the space that we live in extending infinitely in all directions so it is possible to completely cover three-dimensional euclidean Space by disjoint circles so infinitesimal circles disjoint Circles of radius one so what that means is you can put a circle somewhere in space and then put a second Circle somewhere in space that can't intersect with the first one because these are you know solid circles and then another Circle and somehow cover every single point in space with no gaps that's crazy yeah it's crazy it's not the only crazy thing do you have a favorite consequence of the Axiom of choice I mean the bonoctarsky Paradox is a big one so basically it says that you can using just rigid motions I think you can take one ball a solid ball with a finite volume yeah cut it up and then rearrange the pieces so that in the end you get two balls which are the exact same size the exact same volume so you've actually taken one thing and using just pretty normal operations to it you can double it which seems pretty implausible in real life right that seems crazy to me and yet it's irrefutable consequence of this Axiom that you tell me you believe is true yeah so how many infinities are there well definitely uncountably many infinities right so there's no there's certainly no stop to this procedure but could you give a precise cardinal quality to that probably not because if I could there would be a set of all sets right so cantor's diagonal argument can be abstracted and then generalized to prove that for an arbitrary set a its power set has a strictly larger cardinality and since that's true for any set we can just iterate this process when set theory was being discovered or invented or created in the late 19th century one of the natural question to ask is can there be a universe of all sets this comes up in my research in category Theory because even though there is no set of all sets we would really like for there to be a category of so what category theorists need to do to make their work rigorous is to add additional axioms to set theory one of my favorites was introduced by an algebraic geometer Alexander growthendik this is something that we sometimes call a growth indicate Universe they're also an inaccessible Cardinal it's an infinite number that is so big that it cannot be accessed by any of the other constructions within set theory it's so big that we'll never get to it and this allows us to contemplate the collection of all sets whose cardinality is bounded by this size that will never reach so you're just making a cutoff Point you're saying we're never going to get sets bigger than this anyway so we might as well make our category only include things lower smaller than that that's right so a rigorous way to work with a category of sets is to demand that it's a category of sets whose size is bounded by this cardinality Alpha say that is then an example of a category that fits into another even still larger growth in geek Universe beta so implicitly in a lot of my research I have to add an additional assumption that there exists maybe accountably many inaccessible Cardinals
5,examples of infinite sets abound in mathematics you know we see them every day so do those Infinities exist I think you'll get a different answer from every person every mathematician you meet it is a construct so it exists in the same way that things like that like the Poetry exists when you talk about even cardinality and it's just like well here's an infinite Hotel I had one student who was like no no no it's not that does not exist when I describe like well imagine you do this infinitely many times they're done with me because they're like I can't no one can do this infinitely many times right these interesting paradoxes that come from like the ape typing in a typewriter and eventually getting to Hamlet is an example of like well if you give something forever and any random event is going to happen it can be generative yeah sure it's definitely a really interesting really interesting thing to try to talk to students about I mean I'll grant you that Hilbert's Hotel does not exist for me infinite objects absolutely exist and I can't read the thoughts in your head but I have a high degree of confidence that we have a lot of the same ideas about Infinity it's this idea that are things that you can think of do they exist getting into philosophy of math now which is exciting I mean I think that's another common misconception about mathematics is that it's so far removed from the humanities for instance I mean it's hard to ignore some of these philosophical questions particularly when we're talking about certain certain things like infinity and I think one of the most difficult things to really be precise about and to explain to students is the Continuum hypothesis what do you say to students about the Continuum hypothesis the most fun thing to teach when you teach about Infinity when students realize that you are talking about different sizes of Infinity but then a natural thing is for them to think about like what is the next size of infinity that I can think about and sort of the Continuum hypothesis is sort of one of these really hard things to grasp so what's so fascinating about the Continuum hypothesis is you take a subset of the real line that's infinite does it necessarily have either the cardinality of the naturals or the cardinality of Continuum or is there some sort of third possibility what's very surprising is the Continuum hypothesis has been complete completely resolved in the sense that we now know for absolute certain that we will never know whether it's true or false so this is a little bit confusing the standard foundational axioms of mathematics that we take for granted are completely insufficient to prove the Continuum hypothesis one way or the other you know mathematicians among other things have been very clear about exactly what they're taking as an assumption and exactly what they're concluding from it so mathematical practices to be exactly transparent about the hypotheses you need to prove your theorem so now I think of a proof of a theorem more like constructing a function where the domain of that function is all of the hypotheses that I'm assuming and then the target of that function is maybe a particular element in some universe that is the moduli space of the statement that I'm trying to prove or something like this if the foundations were to change if set theory were replaced by something else maybe dependent type Theory do you think the theorems you've proven would still be true there's a lot of math that we sort of take for granted as this is the thing that you can do without really admitting that we are creating the foundations that are the basis for the work we do later and so yes I think that if we change the foundations we would change mathematics but I think that's also very humbling in that it's not that we're sort of discovering a universal truth is we're humans constructing meaning right it's abstract art in a sense there is something there even if you can't see all the pieces for particular things and I think that's really fascinating I was thinking about this on the drive here the way that I interact with infinity I mentioned earlier is is sometimes we in number Theory especially we say well does this type of equation have infinitely many solutions and then you know the question is is are there infinitely many are there not or like you know are there infinitely money twin primes these are sort of interesting ideas but I don't think that knowing if it's infinite or not is necessarily the most interesting thing for me what's been most interesting to me is all the math that gets developed to be able to answer that question giving current technology and who knows what mathematics will look like in 100 years 150 years ago when we barely knew infinity and look where we are today yeah Infinity inspires me to imagine a world that is so much broader than what I'll ever experience with my senses or over the span of a human life the ideas can just go on and on and on forever
1,hi my name is talia gershon and i'm a scientist at ibm research today i've been challenged to explain a topic with five levels of increasing complexity it's a completely different kind of computing called quantum computing quantum computers approach solving problems in a fundamentally new way and we hope that by taking this new approach to computation we'll be able to start exploring some problems that we could never solve any other way hopefully by the end of today everyone can leave this discussion understanding quantum computing at some level what's this yeah what do you think that is fancy chandelier i think so too we jokingly call it the chandelier that's real gold you know this is a quantum computer it's a clunt it's a really special kind of computer what does it do it calculates things but in a totally different way to how your computer calculates things what do you think this is a yeah do you know what your computer thinks that is zero one this really specific combination of zeros and ones everything that your computer does showing you pink panther videos on youtube calculating things searching the internet it does all of that with a really specific combination of zeros and ones which is crazy right that would be like saying your computer only understands these quarters for each quarter you need to tell it that you're going to use heads tails and you assign it heads or tails so i can switch between heads and tails and i can switch the zeros and ones in my computer so that it represents what i wanted to represent like an a and with quantum computers we have new rules we get to use too we can actually spin one of our quarters so it doesn't have to choose just one or the other can computers help you with um your homework your really hard homework yeah they can especially if doing your homework involves calculating something or finding information but what if your homework was to discover something totally new a lot of those discovery questions are much harder to solve using the computers we have today so the reason we're building these kinds of computers is because we think that maybe one day they're going to do a lot of really important things like help us understand nature better maybe help us create new medicines to help people
2,what's your favorite kind of computer smartphone tablet regular laptop pc i've got to go with my iphone so what do you do with your iphone social media um use it for your studying have you ever run out of space on your iphone all the time me too yeah always when i'm trying to take a photo so did you know that there's certain kinds of problems that computers sort of run out of space almost like you're trying to solve the problem and just like how you run out of space on your iphone when you're trying to take a picture if you're trying to solve the problem you just run out of space and even if you have the world's biggest supercomputer did you know that can still happen wow so my team is working on building new kinds of computers all together ones that operate by totally different set of rules so do you know what that is i have no glue it's a quantum computer a what you ever heard of a quantum computer i haven't have you ever heard of the word quantum no okay so quantum mechanics is a branch of science just like any other branch of science it's a branch of physics it's the study of things that are either really really small really really well isolated and really really cold and this particular branch of science is something we're using to totally reimagine how computing works so we're building totally new kinds of computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics that's what a quantum computer is huh i'm going to start by telling you about something called superposition so i'm going to explain it using this giant penny wow is that like worth 100 pennies i don't know what it's worth but uh i can put it face up right in that heads i can put it face down right so at any given time point in time if i ask you is my penny heads or tails probably you could answer it right yeah okay but what if i spin the penny hmm so let's do it okay so while it's spinning is it heads or tails head while it's spinning oh it i would know it's sort of it's sort of a combination of heads and tails right would you say so superposition is this idea that my penny is not just either heads or tails it's in this state which is a combination of heads and tails this quantum property is something that we can have in real real physical objects in the world so that's super position and the second thing that we'll talk about is called entanglement so now i'm going to give you a penny wow when we use the word entangled in everyday language what do we mean that something's intertwined or exactly that there's two things that are connected in some way and usually we can separate them again yeah your hair is tangled or whatever you can you can untangle it right yeah but in the quantum world when we entangle things they're really now connected it's much much harder to separate them again so using the same analogy we spin our pennies and eventually eventually they both stop right and when they stop it's either heads or tails right so in my case i got tails and you got heads you see how they're totally disconnected from each other right our pennies in the real world now if our pennies were entangled and we both spun them together right when we stopped them if you measured your penny to be ahead i would measure my penny to be ahead and if you measured your penny to be a tails i would measure my opinion to be a tails if we measured it at exactly the same time we would still find that they were both exactly correlated that's crazy that's so cool right oh my god the way that we are able to actually see these quantum properties is by making our quantum chips really really cold so that's what this is all about actually this is called a dilution refrigerator and it's a refrigerator it doesn't look like a normal refrigerator right but it's something that we use actually there's usually a case around it to cool our quantum chips down cold enough that we can create superpositions and we can entangle qubits and the information isn't lost to the environment like what could those chips be used to do so one of the things that we're trying to use quantum computers to do is simulating chemical bonding use a quantum system to model a quantum system yeah i mean i'm definitely going to impress all my friends when i tell them about this they're going to be like quantum what
3,so what do you think that thing is is it some sort of conjecture circuit that is a really good guess there's parts of that that are definitely about conducting this is the inside of a quantum computer oh wow yeah this whole infrastructure is all about creating levels that get progressively colder as you go from top to bottom down to the quantum chip which is how we actually control the state of the cupids oh wow so when you say cold or you mean like physically colder yeah like physically colder so room temperature is 300 kelvin as you get down all the way to the bottom of the fridge it's at 10 milli kelvin oh wow yeah amanda what do you study so i'm studying computer science currently a sophomore and the track that i'm in is the intelligent systems track machine learning artificial intelligence you ever heard of quantum computing from my understanding with a quantum computer rather than using transistors is using spins you can have superposition of spins so different states more combinations means more memory so that's pretty good so you mentioned superposition but you can also use other quantum properties like entanglement have you heard of entanglement i have not okay so it's this idea that you have two objects and when you entangle them together they become connected and then they're sort of permanently connected to each other and they behave in ways that are sort of a system now so superposition is one quantum property that we use entanglement is another quantum property and a third is interference how much you know about interference um not much okay so how do noise-canceling headphones work um they read like wave like ambient wavelengths and then produce like the opposite one to cancel out they create interference so you can have constructive interference and you can have destructive interference we have constructive interference you have amplitudes wave amplitudes that add until the signal gets larger and if you have destructive interference the amplitudes cancel by using a property like interference we can control quantum states and amplify the kinds of signals that are towards the right answer and then cancel the types of signals that are leading to the wrong answer so given that you know that we're trying to use superposition entanglement and interference for computation how do you think we build these computers i have no idea so step one is you need to be able to have an object or physical device we call it a qubit or quantum bit that can actually handle those things can actually be put into superpositions of states you know two cubit states that you can physically entangle with each other that's not really trivial right and things in our classical world you can't really entangle things in our classical world so easily we need to use devices where they can they can support a quantum state and we can manipulate that quantum state atoms ions and in our case superconducting qubits we make qubits out of superconducting materials but as like a programmer how would quantum computing affect a different way of writing a program it's a perfect question i mean it's very early for quantum computing but we're building assembly languages we're building layers of abstraction that are going to get you to a point as a programmer where you can interchangeably be programming something the way that you already do and then make calls to a quantum computer so that you can bring it in when it makes sense we're not envisioning quantum computers completely replacing classical computers anytime soon we think that quantum computing is going to be used to accelerate the kinds of things that are really hard for for classical machines so what exactly are some of those problems simulating nature is something that's really hard because if you take something like you know modeling atomic bonding and electronic orbital overlap instead of now writing out a giant summation over many terms you try and actually mimic the system you're trying to simulate directly on a quantum computer which we can do for chemistry and uh we're looking at ways of doing that for other types of things there's a lot of exciting research right now on machine learning trying to use quantum systems to accelerate machine learning problems so would it be like in five years or ten years that i would be able to have like one of these sitting in my laptop just in my dorm i don't think you're going to have one in your dorm room anytime soon but you'll have access to one there's three free quantum computers that are all sitting in this lab here that anyone in the world can access through the cloud okay so quantum computing creates new possibilities and new ways to approach problems that classical computers have difficulty doing couldn't have said it better myself
4,so i'm a first year master's student and i'm studying machine learning so it's in the computer science department but it mixes computer science with math and probability and statistics so have you come upon sort of any limits to machine learning certainly depending on the complexity of your model uh then computational speed is one thing i have colleagues here that tell me it can take up to weeks to train certain neural networks right sure yeah and actually machine learning is one research direction where we're really hoping that we're going to find um key parts of the machine learning computation that can be sped up using quantum computing yeah it's exciting so in a classical computer you know you have all sorts of logical gates that perform operations and they change an input to some sort of output but i guess it's not immediately obvious how you do that with quantum computers if you think about even just classical information like bits right at the end of the day when you store a bit in your hard drive there's a magnetic domain and you have a magnetic polarization right sure you can change the magnetization to be pointing up or pointing down right quantum systems we're still manipulating a device and changing the quantum state of that of that device you can imagine if it's a spin that you could have spin up and spin down but you can also if you isolate it enough you can have a superposition of up and down sure so what we do when we try to solve problems with a quantum computer is we encode parts of the problem we're trying to solve into a complex quantum state and then we manipulate that state to drive it towards what will eventually represent the solution so how do we actually uh encode it to start with yeah that's a really good question this actually is a model of the inside of one of our quantum computers okay so you need a chip with qubits each qubit is a carrier of quantum information and the way we control the state of that qubit is using microwave pulses you send them all the way down these cables and we've calibrated these microwave pulses so that we know exactly this kind of pulse what this frequency and this duration will put the cupid into superposition or we'll flip the state of the qubit from zero to one or if we apply a microwave pulse between two qubits we can entangle them how do we measure yes exactly also through microwave signals okay the key is to come up with algorithms where the result is deterministic interesting so what do those algorithms look like there's sort of two main classes of quantum algorithms there's algorithms which were developed for decades right things like shore's algorithm which is for factoring grover's algorithm for unstructured search and these algorithms were designed assuming that you had a perfect fault tolerant quantum computer which is many decades away so we're currently in a phase where we're exploring what can we do with these near-term quantum computers and the answer is going to be well we need different kinds of algorithms to really even explore that question yeah certainly having a search algorithm is very useful um factoring those are definitely useful things that i would imagine could be done a lot faster on a quantum computer yeah they also unfortunately require fault tolerance right now the algorithms that we know of today to do those things um on a quantum computer require you to have millions of error-corrected qubits today we're at like 50. it's actually amazing that we're at 50. there's things that we know or we have strong reason to believe um are going to be faster to do on a quantum computer and then there's things that we'll discover just by virtue of having one sure how could someone like me who's a grad student get involved in this or what kinds of challenges are you facing that someone like me could help out with i'm glad you're interested i think the place where lots of people can get involved right now is by going and trying it out and thinking about what they could do with it there's a lot of opportunity to find these near-term applications that are only going to be found by trying things out
5,i'm a theoretical physicist i started out in condensed matter theory theory that studies superconductors and magnets and i had to learn a new field of quantum optics and apply those ideas one of the nice things about being a theorist is you get to keep learning new things so steve tell me about your research and the work you've been doing in quantum computing my main focus right now is quantum error correction and trying to understand this concept of fault tolerance which everybody thinks they know it when they see it but nobody in the quantum case can precisely define it it's something that we've already figured out for classical computing like something that amazes me is all the parallels between what we're going through now for quantum computing and what we went through for classical computing i was asking a computer scientist recently where to read about fault tolerance in classical computing he said oh they don't teach that in computer science classes anymore because the hardware has become so reliable in a quantum system when you look at it or make measurements it it can change in a way that's beyond your control we have the following task build a nearly perfect computer out of a whole bunch of imperfect parts common myth how many qubits do you have that's the only thing that matters like just add more qubits what's the big deal pattern them on your chip the great power of a quantum computer is also its achilles heel that it's very very sensitive to perturbations and noise and environmental effects you're just multiplying your problems if all you're doing is adding uh exactly so i think something that frustrates a lot of people about quantum computing is the concept of decoherence right you can only keep your information quantum for so long right and that limits how many operations you can do in a row before you lose your information that's the challenge i would say as much progress as we've made it's a frustration to still be facing it let's talk about some of the things we think need to happen between now and fully fault tolerant quantum computers to get us to that reality i mean there's so many things that need to happen in my mind one of the things we need to do is build all these different layers of abstraction that make it easier for programmers to come in and just enter at the ground level you know yeah exactly so i think there's going to be a kind of co-evolution of the hardware and the software up here and the sort of middleware and the whole stack another common myth in the next five years quantum computing will solve climate change cancer [Laughter] right in the next five years there'll be tremendous progress in the field but people really have to understand that we're either at the vacuum tube or transistor stage we're trying to invent the integrated circuit and scale up it's still very very very early in the development of the field one last myth i think we should bust steve quantum computers are on the verge of breaking into your bank account and breaking encryption and creative cryptography there does exist an algorithm shores algorithm which has been proven mathematically that if you had a large enough quantum computer you could find the prime factors of large numbers the basis of the rsa encryption it's the most commonly used thing on the internet first we're far away from being able to have a quantum computer big enough to execute schwarz algorithm on that scale second there are plenty of other encryption schemes that don't use factoring and i don't think anybody has to be concerned at the moment and in the end quantum mechanics goes to the side of privacy enhancement if you have a quantum communication channel you can encode information and send it through there and it's provably secure based on the laws of physics you know now that everybody around the world can access a quantum computer through the cloud people are doing all kinds of cool things they're building games we've seen the emergence of quantum gains right what do you think people want to do with them i have no idea what people are going to end up using them for i mean if you had gone back 30 years and handed somebody an iphone they would have called you a wizard so things are going to happen that we just can't foresee so i hope you enjoyed that foray into the field of quantum computing i know i've personally enjoyed getting to see quantum computing through other people's eyes coming at it from all these different levels this is such an exciting time in the history of quantum computing only in the last couple years have real quantum computers become available to everyone around the world this is the beginning of a many decade adventure where we'll discover so many things about quantum computing and what it will do we don't even know all the amazing things it's going to do and to me that's the most exciting part you
1,how's it going good cool so do you know what harmony is it's when people sing together and it it sounds nice yeah that's 100 correct have you ever heard a song called amazing grace no it's a good one the melody on its own just goes that melody on its own is kind of lonely right and no one really knows how it feels so which one did you prefer the second one awesome and why did you prefer that one because it sounds better yeah oh that's great i can decide how i want this melody to feel and the more notes there are the more exciting it is that's what musical harmony is does that make sense you're the best
2,have you ever heard of harmony yes okay so what do you think harmony is i think basically it's like one person has the lower voice and like a girl usually has the higher voice yeah and then they blend it together i like it that's absolutely correct harmony is about injecting melody with emotion so that ultimately you leave home and you return home and you've learned something along the way yeah so a nice place to start is with the idea of a triad a triad is a three-part harmony basically so that's a triumph you know so this child is called c major right so have you ever heard this idea of like major chords and minor chords yeah yeah yeah so this is c major yeah and then this is c c minor so the feelings are different right yeah it feels like dark and spooky yeah this one's darker and how does this one make you feel then happy right enjoyable yeah i like that yeah so in amazing grace if you start with f you know if i go there where am i right now i don't know where i am and my job is to get back home but to make it to to make this chord make sense yeah so i might go my job as a harmonizer is to find that narrative and make it make sense that was interesting because i didn't think that that would work together right because there were two completely different sounds but then like it just made it happen and it just was like pow amazing
3,essentially what harmony is is it's like a language right and so as with any language the more words you're capable of speaking in a language the more you can say right so in harmony this might be how many notes you can think to add to a chord to make it feel a different way have you ever heard of the circle of fifths okay that's great on one side we have a lot of the notes which make us feel brighter you know like these kinds of these really bright sounds and the other side is a lot more to do with the darkness of a key center so we're home in f but imagine we're taking a quick visit to b-flat but then the sun comes out oh yeah yeah yeah what notes would you suggest i add f f is a great one yeah and if we keep going in that direction yeah uh c yeah and then g you got it yeah yeah so this is really this is like a gleaming glade or something you know let's play this two amazing grace let's play it in its simplest form yeah all right so we're gonna start an f right yeah f yeah yeah nice okay cool let's try one more version where we add some colors all right so let's visit the b flat with a bit more imagination just to see how things feel yeah all right let's do it so it's f major 7 but it's over a which is f7 over a b flat major 7 with an a energy in it f major 7 with an e and a d and a g in it d minor 7 with the g in it c sauce oh minor nice b flat major g seven f sharp major seven oh yeah i like that so what harmony does is just gives us even more tools to tell those stories cool yeah nice man awesome
4,one nice emotional device when it comes to harmony is just thinking about how to arrive somewhere you know it can be so sparse it can be so rich and it can be really emotional so this idea of the overtone and understand in the harmonic series um how much do you know about this only until i started listening to singing like barbershop quartet and and as i was a violinist as well then i finally understood the idea where the overtone series came from that if a bunch of singers were to nail a chord or have it perfectly tuned uh the overtones you would hear a tone that necessarily wasn't being produced by one of those the amazing thing about harmony is that it it exists in nature so take the harmonic series of the note f for example okay you have the octave and then the fifth then the fourth and then the but that's a little bit sharp with that one and then the intervals get increasingly small beneath that note you have the undertone series which essentially is like a reflection of something in the same way that when a tree grows in nature you have the branches which go upwards and the roots which go downwards so it's quite a nice thing to think about this being the key center the the floor the ground and then these two different directions of ways in which it can express itself and the differences in the sensations with that lots of the time i think when it comes to reharmonization or harmonization people think that the solution to the problems come when we add more notes i think that people forget that you can work with the notes you already have by just rearranging them just the simple idea of inversion you know inversion of the simple triad of f major so i was lost how home do i want to go here you know is there another verse to come right because i can do i can delay the gratification of going home first of all just by using inversions even before we add notes to the chord one thing that i was very joyful to discover is that every single melody note works with every single bass note so you can demonstrate that yeah so this is the note f yeah f major f minor g flat major seven g flat diminished g flat minor major seven g minor seven g sus g seven g seven sharp eleven and then g seven with a flat thirteen right a flat sauce a flat major seven a flat major seven sharp five with the sharp eleven essentially what that demonstrates is that every note and every bass note are compatible so once we realize this it's like that's great now what should we do what should we what do we how what am i supposed to do right and sometimes the paralyzing thing when it comes to arranging there are too many options two things are possible so that's when it becomes super super important to be aware of what you want to try and say emotionally you know but what about negative harmony the dark side so essentially the way i'd apply negative harmony would be this idea of polarity you know between the undertone series and the overtone series or you know the one side and the other side the perfect in the playground the feeling of a minor political cadence resolving is so moving you know and it's just it's a good alternative to something like it's funny you know you doing that makes something in a major key sound like kind of a wistful sad song right you know you changed the feeling of what otherwise would you know if you would tell a kid this is a major song it should be happy exactly yeah no for sure and you know f major can be something you arrive in from if you arrive in f major from d flat then it's like the sun's come out right but if you arrive in f major from a major then it's like the sun's gone in so there's a lot about context i think once you have a language it's about using it and applying it in those emotional ways i think that's what makes the difference
5,a lot of people will see you as somebody who's drank in harmony their whole life they've seen so much harmony heard so much harmony how do you make the choices there's so much that's possible when you know stuff how do you how do you have the courage to make a choice it comes from just your life experience and and that moves you in a certain direction how it gets expressed many times it's a complete surprise yeah yeah yeah i find it fascinating in music to think about you know say i arrive in a place if i'm going say i'm going to d flat major and there was something you once taught me you taught me this song called don't follow the crowd oh yeah and there's that chord it's not a dominant chord but it functions as a dominant chord but it doesn't matter because you're still going to the place you're going to right right it's something like um right right right right yeah so this chord being like a major seven with the sub five and a natural like there's no dominant thing right right but at that moment i'm coming from here and i want to forge some some solution i get myself in a situation yeah yeah yeah right and then that haunted me for days because you know i just wouldn't think to use that chord in that situation yeah and there it was and yeah you know if you read the rule book it's that's not in it yeah and this is what i learned from the great christian chris yeah yeah yeah the idea of going to d flat chord normally it does a dominant like a flat seventh but back in the 20s they also used to do things like oh yeah you know so it's it's always coming yeah coming from just just below the key from c yeah with a seventh yeah and we don't normally say a c seventh and an a flat seventh are related yeah you know because some of that so many of the notes are different because you got this and you got it you got exactly right it gets gnarly right yeah right yeah but if you voice that correctly oh yeah and then you're safe you can get all of those you can get away with it yeah yeah the other thing uh that i like that uh we both do on on occasion is to be on the court we wanna arrive at with the bottom part of our structure and the chord before the arrival chord to have that on top yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right right yeah something like that and that's not because like emotionally it's almost like i'm here i'm arriving here but if the bass note is the same it's like this inevitability about it it's like i was there all along and it makes it makes a pull yeah yeah it happened it's it's like one thing is moving in one direction one thing is arrived so it's this tension and it's right glorious i love thinking about these things emotionally just because that's a feeling i know that feeling in my life music is not different from life no you know and i think that's probably the greatest attraction to those of us who play music yeah was there ever a point in your life when you were younger where you felt like you had consistently fell back into the same habits you know you'd find oh man i'm not going to play this the same thing again i had a really great experience when i was working with miles davis i felt like i was in a rut playing the same stuff and i was getting depressed because of it and miles said something to me i thought he said don't play the butter notes right and so i thought what did he mean by that so you thought it said butter butter not he said bottom but you thought he said butter yeah wow and so i think what what butter b what is butter then i started thinking what are the obvious notes for example in a chord the obvious notes are the third and the seventh so i said oh maybe if i leave those out it changed everything for me from that moment on yeah i got more applause that for that solo than i did the whole week wow i wouldn't play the voicings i play today if that had not happened that's amazing i know i've been using this tune amazing grace oh and so we could play a bit of that if you want to we could talk about some stuff i'll be doing an f do [Laughter] thank you
1,do you know what origami is is that where you fold you fold paper to make different animals like those yes in fact it is have you ever done any origami before nope would you like to give it a try sure okay so we'll do some but i want to tell you a little bit about origami most origami follows two i'll call them customs almost like rules it's usually from a square and the other is it's usually folded with no cuts so these guys are folded from an uncut square that's awesome so you ready yep okay we're going to start with a model that every japanese person learns in kindergarten it's it's called a crane traditional origami design it's over 400 years old so people have been doing what we're about to do for 400 years wow let's fold it in half from corner to corner unfold it and then we'll fold it in half the other direction also corner to corner but we're going to lift it up and we're going to hold the fold with both hands we're going to bring these corners together making a little pocket and then this is the trickiest part of this whole design so you're going to put your finger underneath the top layer and we're going to try to make that layer fold right along the edge now you see how the sides kind of want to come in as you're doing that yeah it's called a petal fold it's a part of a lot of origami designs but it's key to the crane now we're ready for the the magic we're going to hold it in between thumb and forefinger reach inside grab the skinny point that's between the two layers which are the wings and i'm going to slide it out so it pokes out at an angle we'll take the two wings we spread them out to the side and you have made your first origami crane wow now this is a traditional japanese design but there are origami designs that have been around so long we're not entirely sure where they're originated we're going to learn how to fold a cootie catcher so we'll start with the white side up and we're going to fold it in half from corner to corner and we'll unfold and now we're going to fold all four corners to the crossing point in the center we'll fold it in half like a book on the folded side we'll take one of the folded corners i'm going to fold it up through all layers there's a pocket in the middle i'm going to spread the pocket and bring all four corners together where you have original corners of the square we're going to just pop those out this is one of the most satisfying moments i think yeah because it suddenly changes shape i have seen these before my friends use these yeah but there's something else we can do with this model we set it down push on the middle and pop it inside out so that three flaps come up and one stays down and then it's called talking crow because here's a little crow's beak and mouth wow there's thousands of other origami designs but these are some of the first people learn and this was in fact one of the first origami designs i learned some 50 years ago wow so what do you think of that what do you think of origami i think that the people that make them are talented it's hard seeing the stuff that we've made here i'd bet that they could do rocket ships just so much that you can do with them thanks for coming thanks for having me
2,a lot of origami is animals and birds and things there's also a branch of origami that is uh it's more abstract or geometric called tessellations tessellations like most origami are folded from a single sheet of paper but they make patterns like whether it's woven patterns or like that or woven patterns like this if you hold them up to the light you can you can see patterns the thing that makes them cool is they're sort of like tilings it looks like you could put this together by cutting little pieces of paper and sliding them together but there's still one sheet they weren't cut there's no cuts in these just folding we can build these up from smaller building blocks of folds learn how to fold little pieces and put them together in the same way that a that a tiling like this looks like it's built up of little pieces can you make a fold that starts at the dot it doesn't run all the way across the paper how about like that each of these folds is peaked like a mountain and we call these mountain folds okay but if i made it the other way then it's shaped this way and i'll call it a valley fold in all of origami there's just mountains and valleys so all the folds are like reversible so they're all reversible and it turns out that in every origami shape that folds flat it's going to be either three mountains in a valley or if we're looking at the backside three valleys in a mountain they always differ by two that's a rule of all flat origami no matter how many folds come together at a point and i'm going to show you a building block of tessellations it's called a twist because that center square as i unfold it it twists it rotates if i had another twist in the same sheet of paper i could make these folds connect with that and these ones connect with that and if i had another one up here i could make all three and if i had a square array and all the folds lined up i could make bigger and bigger arrays like these because these are just very large twists in this case it's an octagon rather than a square but they're arranged in rows and columns and let's just try going along all right there is our tessellation with squares and hexagons so you've now designed and folded your first origami tessellation and perhaps you can see how just using this idea of building up tiles and small building blocks you could make tessellations as big and complex as you want that was cool yeah so what do you think now of origami tessellations origami i think is the folding of paper to make anything in general from 3d things to like a flat things and i think origami is about turning simple things into complex things and it's all about patterns that is a great definition 
3,so here's a dragonfly and he's got six legs four wings here's a spider with eight legs ants with legs and these just like the crane are folded from a single uncut square what to figure out how to do that we need to to learn a little bit about what makes a point so let's come back to the crane you can probably tell that the corners of the square ended up as points yes right that's a corner four corners the square four points how would you make one point out of this sheet of paper i'm thinking of like a paper airplane yeah exactly actually you've discovered something pretty neat because you made your point not from a corner so you've already discovered one of the key insights any flap any point leg of the ant takes up a circular region of paper here's our boundary to make your point from an edge you use that much paper and the shape it's almost a circle if we take the crane we'll see if the circles are visible in the crane pattern and here's the crane pattern and here's a boundary of the wing okay and here's the other wing the crana has four circles but actually there's a little bit of a surprise because what about this there's a fifth circle which is like that but does the crane have a fifth flap in it let's refold it and put the wings up well yes there is there's another point and that point is the fifth circle of our crane okay and to do that we use a new technique called circle packing in which all of the long features of the design are represented by circles so each leg becomes a circle each wing becomes a circle and things that can be big and thick like the head or the abdomen can be points in the middle now we have the basic idea of how to design a pattern we just count the number of legs we want we want a spider if it's got let's say eight legs it's also got an abdomen that's another point and it's got a hit so maybe that's ten points if we find an arrangement of 10 circles we should be able to fold that into the spider so in this book origami insects 2 is one of my books and has some patterns and this is one of them for flying ladybug and in fact it is exactly this flying ladybug we've got the crease pattern here in the circles and you might now be able to see which circles end up as which parts knowing that the largest features like the wings are going to be the largest circles smaller points will be smaller circles so any thoughts which might be well the legs and the antenna would probably have to be these smaller ones in the middle that's right oh this looks like the back because it's a bunch of circles all the way down like here exactly and then and then the wings you've got four big wings which you can see on the ends there and then i guess my head you got it so you are ready to design origami awesome origami artists all around the world now use ideas like this to design not just insects but animals and birds and all sorts of things that are i think unbelievably complex and realistic but most importantly beautiful wow that's so impressive i think i learned how to make one of these paper creams when i was in third grade but i guess i never unfolded it to actually see where it was coming from and so now that it's all broken up into circles it makes these super complicated you know insects and animals and everything seems so much simpler so that's so cool that's really exciting about it thank you so much for telling me about this
4,whenever there's a part of a spacecraft that is shaped somewhat like paper meaning it's big and flat we can use folding mechanisms from origami to make it smaller telescopes solar arrays they need to be packed into a rocket go up but then expand in a very controlled deterministic way when they get up in the space these are the the building blocks of many many origami deployable shapes it's called a degree 4 vertex it's the number of lines so in this case we use solid lines for mountain we use dashed lines for valley we're going to fold it and use these two to illustrate some important properties of origami mechanisms it's important in the study of mechanisms to take into account the rigidity so what we're going to do to help simulate rigidity is to take these rectangles and we're going to fold them over and over so that they just become stiff and rigid okay so this is what's called a single degree of freedom mechanism you have one degree of freedom i can choose this form and then if these are perfectly rigid every other fold angle is fully determined one of the key behaviors here is that with the smaller angles up here the two folds that are the same parity and the folds that are of opposite parity move at about the same rate but with this as we're getting closer to 90 degrees we find they move at very different rates and then at the end of the motion the opposite happens this one is almost folded but this one goes through a much larger motion so the right the relative speeds differ so when we start sticking together vertices like this if they're individually single degree of freedom then we can make very large mechanisms that open and close but with just one degree of freedom so these are examples of a pattern called the miura ori when you stretch them out they're pretty big okay and they fold flat and a pattern almost exactly like this was used for a solar array for a japanese mission that flew in 1995. so then you like fly it up compactly and then once you get up there there's like some sort of like motorized mechanism but you only need it on one fold yeah so typically what the mechanism will run from corner to corn two diagonally two opposite corners okay because then you can stretch it out that way notice some differences between the one you have and the one i have and how this one sort of opens out almost evenly and but this one opens out more one way and then the other yeah what sort of angle would you want so that they open at the same rate infinitesimally small so sadly the only way to get them at exactly the same rate is when these are microscopic slivers then that's for useful and it's exactly the difference between the motions of these two vertices so these angles are closer to right angles and the closer you get to a right angle the more asymmetry there is between the two directions right and then the other difference is how efficiently they pack so these started at about the same size but when they're flat notice that yours is much more compact so if i were making a solar array i'd say oh i want that one but if i say well i want them to open at the same rate then i want this one so there's kind of a trade-off there's an engineering trade-off to get them both to work and there's another place that shows up in deployable structures in a very cool structure this is a folded tube it sort of pops out like this but it has this neat property that if you twist it quickly it changes color there's a mars rover application where they they need a sleeve that protects a drill and as the drill goes down the sleeve is going to collapse and they're using a pattern very much like this interesting there are many open mathematical questions and so room for mathematicians like yourself to have a big impact on the world of origami and mechanisms and even though those studies are mathematically interesting they're going to also have real world applications in space solar arrays drills telescopes and more any questions or thoughts about this if you want to like send something to space it probably makes sense to do it compactly so if you have something that you can fold up and then unfold at just like one of the folds that's going to be probably the easiest way to get something up there and expand it to what it needs to be
5,i'm tom hull i'm a math professor mathematician i've been doing origami since i was eight years old and studying the mathematics of origami ever since grad school at least the first thing i want to show you is origami in the real world this is the origami lamp it comes shipped flat but it folds clip holds it together the lamp has leds on the inside so when we power it up we get light we have a lampshade and we get the base why does origami lend itself to say this type of application origami applications have in common is that at some stage the thing is flat and so whenever you need to either start from a flat state and then take it to a 3d state or conversely for deployables like space you want to have it in a fully folded flat state but then take it to a 3d state or possibly an unfolded flat state whenever a flat state is involved origami is a really effective way of making the transition between those states another aspect of origami and origami mechanisms that has lent itself to many different uses is the fact that it's scalable when you have an origami crease pattern like the mirror ori used in solar panel deployment the type of motion that you see happening here will happen whether this is on a piece of paper that's small like this or on a larger scale or even on a smaller smaller smaller smaller scale engineers in particular robotics engineers are turning to origami for designing mechanisms that will either be really big or really really small this looks like the most promising way of getting nano robotics to work this is another real world application but this particular implementation is used to make a wheel for a rover cool so this is something that can actually get really really tiny but then get big and fat and roll new problems arise when we try to make origami out of things other than paper yeah but also new opportunities an example here which is a kind of a variant of the miura ori it's got a three-dimensional structure if i stretch it one way it expands the other but because it has these s bends in the pattern if you squeeze it it doesn't go all the way flat yeah this is a epoxy impregnated aramid fiber and so if i put this fold pattern into it and then compress it and then put a skin on the top and bottom this becomes incredibly lightweight but incredibly strong yeah another origami challenge that comes up with these patterns is we're going to make an aircraft out of this thing we're going to need hundreds of yards of folded origami we're not going to do it by hand and this might be the new frontier in origami engineering which is the design of machines that can fold patterns that have applications so talking about a machine that is actually folding it into this not just making the creases but yeah actually folding it so what goes in his sheet and what comes out is this or something this y that's cool yeah what do you see as kind of like the next big breakthrough is there anything out there on the horizon that you're just like oh wow this is really exciting it's something we've talked about a little bit that with all the richness of behavior of uh origami from a flat sheet it seems like there ought to be an equally rich world of things that don't start flat but are still made from flat sheets of paper like a cone bistable properties and you can combine them together with the copies of themselves to make cellular structures they're astonishingly stiff and rigid useful for mechanics the thing that i think i'm the most excited about comes from math mainly when i look at origami when i look at all these applications or just all these different origami folds i see structure math is really about patterns the patterns that we see in origami are reflecting some kind of mathematical structure and we don't quite know yet what all of that structure is and if we can tie a mathematical structure that's already well studied to something we see happening in origami then we can use the math tools right away to help solve the engineering problems and the origami problems and the fact that there's so many applications to this is really making people excited who are working in the area i'm really excited to see what happens with that in the next five years 
1,do you know what we're going to talk about today it's called blockchain what's blockchain that's a really good question it's actually a way that we can trade do you know what trade is it's like it's when you take turns every time that's when you give a most of what you want right when you give up most of what you want well sometimes that definitely happens for sure what if i told you that there's a kind of technology that i work on that means you could trade with any kid all over the world really yeah if i could trade with any kid i would trade well i would chase something i don't like so much that's probably a good idea maybe somebody else likes it more than you do so normally when people trade they have to go to the store or they have to know the person so that they can get what they asked for with blockchain you can make that exact same trade but you don't need the store and you don't even necessarily need to know the other person really really
2,so ian do you know what blockchain is no have you ever traded or sold anything actually i'm selling my computer on ebay right now that's amazing what made you decide to trade on ebay um well i mean i've heard of it and i trust it a lot because there's they have like all their guarantees so i i know that i'm gonna get money and the person's gonna get what they want so what if i told you that blockchain technology is basically a tool where you can do the exact same thing but it goes to you and i directly you wouldn't need an ebay or a brand in between that's cool and there's a lot of those kinds of middlemen in our society today right we have a lot of banks we have a lot of companies that sort of help us make sure that our trades happen but if we could guarantee the same trade using technology as sort of like a technological trust then we wouldn't really need all those middlemen in between so how does it work it's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions and so instead of sort of there being one company with one database that holds all the information the same sort of list is held by all these different people like you could have it on your computer and then it gets validated by everyone and basically that turns into the next part of the list so it's sort of constantly updating itself so like how do you make sure that it's secure so it uses cryptography and that helps it basically encode all of the transactions so you can't really see exactly what happened but you know it happened because it's like a marker so you could kind of like i don't know say trade you trade apples but you would just see like random letters yeah for it so you wouldn't be able to like track it i guess exactly that's cool so it's kind of this like really big ledger or accounting system for all sorts of things that get traded but instead of being owned by one company it's owned by everybody that's cool yeah
3,technology have you heard of blockchain i've heard of the words blockchain but i'm not sure i know what it is so when we were much smaller societies you and i could trade in our community pretty easily but as the distance in our trade grew we ended up inventing institutions right if you use uber or you use airbnb or you use amazon even these are just digital marketplaces and platforms that help us facilitate an exchange of value but today we actually have a technology that allows us to trade one-to-one but at scale and it's called blockchain technology there is some kind of interface for it you could have an app or you could use your computer to do it but instead of there being a company in the middle or what's helping you make that transaction is a bunch of software code and so it's being run by all of these different computers that have like a node so they're all running the same software and guaranteeing your transactions um as they happen i mean i would assume this technology is taking away business or activity from these middlemen in some cases yeah it is and a lot of people in the financial industry in particular are looking at it from the banking side of how do we use this technology to trade things like bitcoin or other tokens that um are easier to use instead of today's currency you know a lot of people think about blockchain as bitcoin because it's sort of in the news a lot and it's this new cryptocurrency and it's kind of exciting but we're actually seeing a lot more use cases for blockchain that aren't around the currency side they're more around how do you take any asset and be able to trade that using the same technology is there a mechanism for verifying that person a is a legitimate seller or producer of the item so today a lot of people are working on how to create identity structures that leverage blockchain and one of the tools for doing that is being able to cryptographically sign for a given attribute so your government could sign that you have a u.s passport or a university could sign that you are a currently enrolled student and you could then dole out that information and control it yourself and be able to show people those certifications on an as needed basis
4,blockchain technology okay have you ever heard of blockchain i have whenever we have a transaction and let's say i buy something from you this information gets logged and it gets verified by a third person or third party and then if like all this information verified and it all matches right the transaction goes through without any intermediary basically right and it gets stored and when we make further transactions this information is already embedded it's in the in the ledger yeah that's exactly right and you can append it you can sort of add new information that's more current but you can't actually go erase anything absolutely right the way the technology is changing nothing's gonna be like it used to be and there's no like firm and then the buyer and the seller and it's basically we'll have to rewrite a lot of rules and economics as well for sure a lot of the assumptions won't hold true same with who are the who are the actors it's not just people anymore it's machines absolutely we're going to have to create entire new concepts of how they do trade and how they work with us too what kind of barriers or roadblocks would you imagine are going to happen in the blockchain space so at least when we we talk about bitcoin there are some trust issues there have been some hacks and uh so there is obviously a need to to work on on trust and feeling that it's uh it's the safe technology yeah one of the problems that bitcoin has faced is bitcoins getting stolen or lost but a lot of that actually comes from people trying to recentralize bitcoin in different ways making themselves actually a pretty easy target absolutely so education will be a big part before we actually can use the technology very in in the wide sense right yeah to actually transition into the mainstream and and make it useful for average people to use we're going to need to make sure we have a lot more education a lot more standards and probably work with a lot of enterprises to create sort of the user experience around this being a technology that is safe and usable and understandable what is the current state of blockchain in your understanding what's going to have to happen next the current state is in this the research state and it's being developed to to be applied in many many areas it might be used almost everywhere to where like we won't even imagine how we lived without it but i'm not sure where it's going to go i mean no one really knows right well we have a lot of uh public blockchains like we have bitcoin we have the ethereum network nxt but a lot of companies and consortiums are getting together to build private blockchains so ones that are more closed off at first and then may evolve into a public network when people feel comfortable using it and some are also proof of concepts out in the real world projects in energy and in pharmaceuticals and in retail and lots of different fields are starting experiments and we'll see in the next few years how all of those interact and what we learn about the best use cases for blockchain and what it means for trade so tell me your version of a technical
5,definition of blockchain a technical definition of blockchain is that it is a persistent transparent public append-only ledger so it is a system that you can add data to and not change previous data within it it does this through a mechanism for creating consensus between scattered or distributed parties that do not need to trust each other but just need to trust the mechanism by which their consensus has arrived at in the case of blockchain it relies on some form of challenge such that no one actor on the network is able to solve this challenge consistently more than everyone else on the network so it randomizes yes yeah it randomizes the process and in theory ensures that no one can force the blockchain to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with one that relies on a mechanism for a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and then verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter after the fact and do you see it as defining a new discipline of kinds or where where are we going to see blockchain emerge in the real world first i mean just so like as an example one thing that i think about a lot in terms of possible blockchain applications is electricity right the next generation of distributed smart grid technology effectively sure and people are working on that already yeah yeah exactly and it's this very fruitful area of research and you can find yourself looking like 20 years out right where you have an enormous number like of electric cars you have all of these batteries like that's essentially um a distributed peak load power grid right like the cars are getting plugged in and unplugged at different times if you have a mechanism that is able to automatically and autonomously be distributing power based on batteries that are scattered throughout the grid that are being used for other purposes their owners don't even necessarily need to be aware you begin to have something that looks like a much more viable society that still has a lot of electricity needs but is able to base that much more on renewables is able to make up the difference during peak load periods or during differences in weather that is able to have power much closer to where it's needed rather than having to be distributed over great distances like that's something that would be an enormously hard problem to solve and it's not that the blockchain makes it easy but it makes it possible a lot of people are seeing blockchain in the news and maybe seeing a lot of sort of initial coin offerings this sort of monetization opportunity around blockchain and are getting very excited about it and some of that excitement is is real and should be you know encouraged but some of it is also hype how do you feel about the hype cycle around blockchain today i'm glad you mentioned initial coin offerings um because for me those really exemplify the sort of the the problem that we're having at this exact moment they are a an idea with enormous potential significance down the road however the promise of the initial coin offering has been kind of hijacked into this string of like basically pump and dump scams or sort of desperate gold rush schemes the faster that we can we can shift from this this fantasy that it is going to make you rich in a sort of you know 1920s tulip bubble kind of way um is is that is the sooner that we can get into people honestly and i mean this like with all the hope in the world people being disappointed in blockchains like oh i didn't get rich it's just being used now to make it easier to transact goods and services safely across borders this isn't exciting at all and then we'll see that like become part of the everyday infrastructure of the world in a way that i think will be very significant but i think it is now almost every aspect of it that's connected with the concept of money is wildly overhyped um and it also creates a problem which is people get a lot of excitement around it and then they're waiting for the world to change yeah right where where is this technology why haven't i seen anything changing yes yes because we've had a lot of pr a lot of proof of concept but yeah truthfully this is more like a science right it will develop it will take five years it will take 10 years that kind of time is necessary one of the areas that brought me to supply chain research is the fact that we're we're not just going to see blockchain emerge we're going to see artificial intelligence continue to evolve we're gonna see connected devices and this sort of growing internet of things machinery that can do a lot more and have a wallet and transact on their own and so i actually think a lot of where blockchain and other technologies are headed is this interesting synergy that will help us elevate the kinds of institutions we've used in the past and cobbled together to create that identifiable verifiable trust yes and one of the most interesting ideas to me that came out of the currency side of the blockchain project was the notion around like coloring coins right assign properties to a particular coin and in particular to assign those properties in ways that would allow you to do things like bring in the graph of previous transactions you know there's sort of an obvious application for this which is something that would look a little bit like an extreme version of like a boycott divestment and sanctions kind of approach right a model where it's sort of like i will not touch money my wallet will automatically not touch money that has been exchanged with the following as a sort of very extreme way of cutting those things out but there's also ways in which i think that could be applied to to clearing out the entire logistics process of many kinds of bad actors but trying to make a supply chain better in some ways relies a lot on whose version of better that is and exactly kind of what gets qualified but also how that is quantified within say some kind of like smart contract system there's multiple ways that i could see this backfiring and one is the ways in which that is implemented for example leaving certain kinds of bad behavior untouched or unanalyzed or one that feels even more dire to me in some ways is creating an extremely inflexible con like because human contracts legal contracts are actually very flexible like there's a lot of kind of room to move and renegotiate yeah but we we already have real world versions of some of these nightmare scenarios right where like your kid has a medical emergency and you can't unlock your car because you're two days behind on payments for it and so the car system will no longer respond to the app mechanism that you're supposed to be able to use to drive it barrier being sort of a rigidity in structures that maybe don't accommodate real life scenarios very well as you and i have been talking one of the things that keeps coming up is that we tend to hold novel technologies to an unrealistically high standard in terms of what they are supposed to deliver rather than comparing them to actually existing systems where we can begin to see the possibility that even like a slight incremental improvement would still be an enormous gain the system we have today is also broken right it's it's hard to compare it to some perfect future just like we compare um you know autonomous vehicles to this very high standard because machines are doing it should be perfect right there should be zero car deaths and when you say well there's hundreds of thousands millions of you know car deaths on the road due to human error today i think we're in a similar place we're going to see problems with this technology and we are going to need to develop multiple kinds of standards that also have some flexibility but it's it's going to also be a version a system that allows us to fix some of the things that are broken today blockchain may sound complicated but at its core it's just another tool for humans and eventually robots and other kinds of identities to trade at scale and make that trade more decentralized and it's part of our future so it's important that people have these kinds of conversations and start to learn about it
1,hi are you bella yes bella i'm george nice to meet you nice to meet you i'm a research scientist do you like science yeah i wanted to talk to you about a specific type of science called nanotechnology have you ever heard of this word before nano's kind of a funny word right it's a word that's used before another word and it means one billion what's the smallest object you can think of a baby ant a baby and very good so i have over here a meter stick let me show it to you and so that's a meter and if i divide it by 1000 i get a millimeter so milly just means one thousandth there's all these little lines on the ruler and each of those little lines is one millimeter so baby and is probably a couple of millimeters so even the thing that's the smallest thing you can think of it's a million times bigger than a nanometer tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny if i took this stick and i was to draw one billion lines the distance between those two lines would be one nanometer so that's really all it is it's just a measure of size but it's really really really tiny you know smaller than anything that we can see with our with our eyes the reason why in nanotechnology we you know in scientists we care about things that are that small is because there are objects called atoms have you ever heard of atoms before yes um i first heard of them on a show i watched called storybots they're just little things that make up like everything on earth even earth that is a perfect explanation but what if i told you that scientists invented a special type of microscope that not only lets you see atoms but also lets you move them around and build things with them would you think that would be pretty cool yeah so it's called a scanning tunneling microscope and not only can you see the atoms but you can move them around atoms are kind of sticky you can actually build things using this instrument with actual individual atoms so if i gave you that machine would you want to make something would you want to look at something very carefully i would want to make a unicorn have the atoms you are definitely a second grader my daughter would probably answer the exact same way a unicorn would be awesome why do you study stuff so small i study it because objects that are that small have really interesting properties they behave completely different than objects that are big and because of that we can build really cool things with them like really fast computers for example or new types of batteries or new types of solar cells and a lot of nanotechnology is kind of like playing with legos you take these small objects and you you put them together to build something new something interesting that no one's built before it's like legos for scientists cool
2,so how old are you i'm 16. 16. so what is that you're in 10th grade junior year so 11th grade so have you heard of nanotechnology have you heard of this term before yeah i've heard of it what do you think of when you think of nanotechnology it kind of seems very science fiction you know you're right when you read about some of these technology it does feel like science fiction but the part of nanotechnology i wanted to talk to you about is stuff that you probably use every day most of your day all of the time can you guess what aspect of our technology i want to talk to you about my phone yeah so modern computer chips rely heavily on nanotechnology does this look familiar to you can you guess what this might be i don't know so this is a silicon wafer and they're embedded in basically almost every object that you use from a laptop to a phone to cars television sets appliances we end up cutting these into little squares and those repeating patterns each of those is a processor and those chips are what goes into all of these objects what i want to talk to you about is how we got from kind of where we started and how we're able to actually fit 18 billion of these little devices in a little you know one inch by one inch uh area they're called transistors it's a switch very simply think of it as a light switch that turns on and turns off using an electric field by applying a voltage i went through my kids lego bins to build a very simple model of a transistor and these are wired together in circuits so that you can do computation you can do logic with them where nanotechnology comes into play the way you double the number of transistors on a chip can you guess what you would have to do to this transistor you make it smaller you have to make it smaller exactly but here's the problem so about oh 10 to 15 years ago the devices got so small that if you shrunk them this gate that actually turns it on and off loses its ability to control the channel and so they did was they took devices like this into these things we call them finfets kind of like a fin on a fish so they're very thin transistors the width of these fins is only six nanometers okay so six nanometers is 25 to 30 atoms across and they repeat this over the entire wafer just about perfectly it's just a huge feat in engineering but these types of devices are exactly the kind of devices that your phones and computers either have or will have in the near future and it's a way that nanotechnology is directly impacting you right now how do you make stuff that small like obviously it's not handmade so is it like factories and stuff exactly so these are made using a technique called lithography you basically cope the silicon wafer with a polymer then you put a mask on it and then you shine light through it and the features of the mask the size of those holes determine the feature size in the chip it's not just the size of the mask that matters it's the wavelength of the light that's used we talked about nanotechnology being science fiction before but this is real stuff that's being produced that's being made that's being used every day by people in middle school i've built all the like the little switches where you turn the electricity on and it goes from like one thing to the other but those are like the really big like comical like plugging in like legos and stuff when we saw the picture of all of the little ones like it's like a city it's crazy how simple and complex it is at the same time exactly i couldn't put it
3,so what's your major chemical engineering what made you choose that like any freshman going into chemical engineering i was like i like chemistry so i'm gonna go into chemical engineering but luckily i also like you know all the math and all the science too so have you taken a quantum mechanics course i have i took that last year i think to really get deep into nanomaterials and nanoscale devices you really have to understand to some level quantum mechanics what it teaches us as we make these devices smaller and smaller their properties begin to now depend on the size and the orientation of these devices there are materials and you're taking a 2d materials class you know about this that are intrinsically thin like as they're grown as they're fabricated they're already at the nanoscale and they possess these quantum confinement properties that as a nanotechnologist you try to exploit and so the first ones i wanted to talk to you about are quantum dots have you heard of quantum dots before yes so these are typically semiconductors they can be cadmium selenide cadmium sulfide zinc cell not and they're small clusters of atoms they can be from two to 10 nanometers what's interesting about these materials well the other day we were talking about the kind of different dimensions you can have of nano technology so all the way from like 0d to 3d if i remember correctly my professor labeled it as 0d that's correct yeah because of quantum confinement once you get below this 15 nanometer range the band gap of the material depends completely on the size of the material so in bulk materials if you want to change the band gap you have to change the material right but in these quantum dots specifically just by changing the size you can change their band gap and because their band gap is changing their optical properties are different and you can precisely tune the wavelength of light that they emit just by changing their size what are the applications of these quantum dots there are people that are exploring using these materials for diode lasers there are companies that are building displays from these materials and there are even people thinking about if i take these quantum dots and i change the chemistry on the outside so they stick to specific types of cells or tissue that i could really do some interesting imaging and therapeutic work to track disease even maybe to treat disease if you can very precisely control the chemistry how far away is this from being actually used on an industrial level the optical applications are in development the science has really been worked out the health stuff because of all of the things you have to consider when you're putting something in someone's body is definitely further out there for example some of them are made from cadmium cadmium's toxic you would never put that in someone's body but there are other materials like gold and silver and titanium dioxide which are less toxic and people are exploring using those so have you learned about graphene yeah do you know what this is carbon nanotube carbon nanotube right so if you roll up graphene depending on how you roll it and the angle you roll it with it has different properties so if i roll it one way it'll act like a metal if i roll it a different way it'll act like a semiconductor the one that gets everyone most excited is that the electrons and holes move very fast through through graphene and so there's a lot of interest in using these for certain types of high speed electronics the other interesting application is because it's one atom thin it's very sensitive to changes in the environment and so there's a lot of interest in using them as diagnostics it's on us researchers to find ways to a control that process and then be to actually build some sort of interesting technology from them so you've been talking about the different ways you can say roll these nanotubes so how do you go about building and controlling these nanotubes in terms of their diameter so you're you're speaking my language this is what i spent many years of my life working on you don't physically roll up graphene you grow nanotubes by basically taking nanocrystals and you deposit them on a surface and then you do a cvd process chemical vapor deposition so you basically flow in a carbon source the carbon dissolves in a nanocrystal and then once the nanocrystal is saturated the nanotubes precipitate out of them in tubes then you have to develop ways to go into this pile of nanotubes and pull out exactly the ones that you want so i have to find ways to program them to go exactly in the places that i want i modify the surface of the nanotube with specific molecules that recognize one type of surface over another and then i just pattern the surface and the tubes just land exactly where we want them to and it's still very much in the research stage the ultimate goal is to build functional high speed electronics using these these new materials in my nano materials class actually just a couple days ago we were talking about different applications of nanotechnology and things we know and we touched on the topic that right now silicon is kind of down to the smallest level that it can get and so we have scientists out there researching other materials drilled by silicon yeah 100 that's right and that's the motivation for looking at these emerging materials but i would never bet against the innovation and the creativity in this nano electronics space tens of thousands of scientists every time they hit a barrier at least historically as a guy they have found a way to overcome it i mean it's a real marvel in ingenuity so i gotta ask the lights that are behind you is that related to the quantum dots that you work with at all it's just pretty lights but now that you suggested it these were inspired by the array of quantum dots that we showed earlier so that's the story i'm going to stick with i like it well thank you so much this was all so very interesting
4,me a bit about your work i'm working on energy storage materials and the most popular uh our batteries that we work on a lot of the revolution that's come in electronics is kind of our model to try and use some nanoscale advances and put them in uh to batteries what is it about nanomaterials that scale and the properties of these materials that make them uniquely promising to incorporate into battery technology so for batteries one of the main constraints when we're designing batteries is trying to maintain or reduce the volume and mass of the components and nanomaterials are particularly well suited to adding functionality while having this negligible increase in volume so we get a huge benefit from using nanomaterials without sacrificing the volume of the battery what is it exactly that you're trying to tease out of these materials to improve the battery's performance at first one of the main things that we did was use nanomaterials to add conductivity and so carbon analysis and graphene are really good at adding conductivity to batteries and then in the subsequent years nanomaterials have been really interesting from things like incorporating sensors into batteries so increasing the functionality of batteries having some responsive materials that use things like graphene sheets that are incorporated into a matrix and then you add a safety functionality to a battery we're trying to squeeze out almost all the functionality that we can and as new nanomaterials are being discovered in their new properties being discovered a lot of the time that that someone tries to think of a way to translate that into a battery because the materials are so small they're at the nano scale their properties are dominated by quantum mechanics which means that even slight changes in their size in their orientation get profound changes in their properties and while that's very scientifically interesting and it allows you to tune their properties by making subtle changes from a technology point of view it actually is it's a bit of a headache in the sense and technology we want to optimize for a property and then repeat that over and over again so what are some of the challenges that you face in the lab related to working with these materials and trying to incorporate them into uh into the batteries i think every step of a process in a battery is kind of something where you have to think about how would this translate to making a battery in terms of the production one thing that i think is very interesting about the field of nanoscale materials in general is that how you make the material changes the properties a lot and so if we claim that this 2d material has this property then tying that to the battery performance is something that's pretty difficult to do it takes a few steps in between so we have to think kind of creatively with how we can do that that's actually i think a very common problem we can build a device in the lab it could be a transistor can be a battery and then you ask the question okay so what's the next step how do we take it from that lab demonstration into a technology the kind of work that i'm very interested in is developing tools to make the exact type of materials that you want the tools that we use in the past for conventional fabrication just don't work with these these materials because they're all grown from the bottom up they're intrinsically small and you have to find ways to either use chemistry or some other means to get them to assemble into the structures that you want to actually either grow specifically what you want or after you grow them to pull out the ones that you want you need to be able to build that same thing over and over again with the exact same properties no one institution no one research lab no one national lab is going to solve all of these problems on their own because they are difficult problems and there is a real important payoff at the end and it's going to take all of us making our contributions to push to push
5,i remember reading your papers when i was a student and you know we're all trying to create these materials and finding ways to exploit their their properties what i love and i'm delighted that you're here to talk to us about is how you took inspiration from nature and sort of recognize that nature's figure out a way to both synthesize incredibly complex nanostructures with high functionality and how you sort of were inspired by that to do the research that you're that you're doing now life gave us this toolkit that is already on the nanoscale so we think that that's a great place to think about making materials on the nanoscale and manipulating materials on the nanoscale and actually and wiring them together as well this abalone shell you can see the exquisite beautiful colors and structures of it this is a nano composite material if you take this and fracture it and you look at it in a scanning electron microscope what you'll see is it's made out of these beautiful tablets and i studied that as a graduate student i looked at that and i said that is completely amazing you have an organism in the ocean that takes what's in its environment which is calcium and carbonate that's dissolved in the water and templates it into this really exquisite structure and so you think that's great calcium carbonate is great but what if we wanted to make a solar cell or a another electronic device or a a battery how would you get an organism to do that and you say okay that's a really crazy idea but is it really that crazy if this abalone you know already figured out how to do it you know 500 million years ago so we're saying okay abalones build shells can viruses build solar cells can viruses build catalysts can they build uh batteries using the same kind of idea it's really fascinating work especially now we're all familiar with with viruses and how they act and i'm not aware of any viruses that build nanostructures so i mean how did you come to that and then how do you actually you know program a virus to do your bidding we work on something called bacteriophages it's a virus with dna this particular bacteriophage called m13 bacteriophage is made up of single stranded dna and proteins it's long and thin so it's 880 nanometers in length and it's about nine nanometers in diameter and so one of the reasons i love it is it spans the nanoscale and almost the micron scale at the same time take the single strand dna obviously a model and you can cut it with molecular scissors and you can put a new piece of dna in between and so you put a small piece of dna in there that doesn't doesn't belong there and that piece of dna is going to randomly code for a protein now the next time that that virus is replicated within a bacterial host it'll be able to put a new protein sequence on the coat just a short protein sequence on the coat maybe like eight or twelve amino acids in length and just like that avalon is going to grab calcium and build calcium carbonate we're gonna have our viruses build iron phosphate for a battery electrode material or gallium arsenide or cad sulfide for a semiconductor material so you've evolved and i suppose trained these viruses to build the materials that you want them to build by exposing them to the raw materials and then you know evolving their their function we're trying to build electronics from nanomaterials the critical issue that we're facing is how do you go from those single experiments with the single material understanding its properties how do you scale that to the billions of devices that you need in a technology it is a you know a chemistry driven approach we're not going to grow them exactly where we want them but to take that one you know one step and to tie it into what you're doing it sounds like there could be an area of collaboration where instead of using sort of conventional chemistry that we can train some of these biological elements to do that to do that work work for us biology is is chemistry molecules proteins and dna work with all the same kinds of bonding and and things that the chemicals that that you're going to be looking for in these in these processes it's put together uh in a way that when a a protein or enzyme uh folds it almost always folds correctly that's kind of the beauty of it the predictable aspect of it encoded in its dna if we need to make it the same over and over again then as long as you have the right dna sequence dna is a beautiful structure on the nanoscale and there's really really cool incredible work on dna origami where dna can fold into just the right right structure and so i can see that as an interface that would be really um cool and interesting in your work and you can have the virus make the dna for the dna origami and then use dna to assemble your uh beautiful structures it's really fascinating you have all these little worker viruses building the materials for you how are you then applying these materials that you're that you're building we started thinking about how can we make an impact in cancer we do it mostly in imaging technology to look deep inside the body non-invasively with light and the way that we came about that was through solar cells and batteries we trained our viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and hold on to them very very tightly and then we'll we'll give a virus a second gene to code for a protein to grow in the case of a battery a battery electrode material it allows it to weave together a good electrical conductor and a good ionic conductor at the same time all in the within this really really small space and the optical properties of these carbon nanotubes are in the wavelength that is interesting for imaging deep inside the body we started building a bunch of imaging tools that could image um above a thousand nanometers uh wavelength and so this is in near ir's and that's a really special window where you have some optical transparency of of tissue in the body the other gene we engineered to find ovarian cancer we developed imaging tools with harvard medical school and mit lincoln labs to find tiny ovarian tumors it's hard to see things less than a centimeter in size with ovarian cancer just based on the location in the body but with our imaging system we could find tumors that were below a millimeter in size actually looking ahead five years ten years you know where do you see your own work and maybe the field more broadly the future i'd like to see is environmentally friendly chemistry and materials synthesis and i think that we're really going that way if we think about batteries of the future solar cells of the future uh thinking about earth abundant materials and processes that are compatible with the earth and environment one of the things i love about about ammo science is it tends to break up the silos between those traditional scientific disciplines my training was in chemistry but i had a very quickly merged chemistry in physics and now i see an area where chemistry physics and biology are coming together to produce new materials and new technology into it and to advance the field forward and so being in this field you kind of have to cross-pollinate you know between these different disciplines and kind of advance the field together i agree completely we like to solve problems nanobio is the toolkit that we bring a lot it happens to be a very strong and evolving toolkit that's another thing that i love about biology is if you can come up with a solution that's not perfect at all to begin with when you're making a battery electric material or any kind of material you're making you have evolution on your side to try to make it better and better as a function of time that can be quite rapid so angela thank you so much for joining us and i look forward to seeing more work coming out of your lab in the in the future thanks for having me george it was really fun to interact and i'm very excited about our future collaboration me too absolutely i really enjoy talking to these five different people about nanotechnology nanotechnology is a field that affects all of us every day as it finds its way into a variety of applications and i hope you enjoyed it as well and see the impact that nanotechnology has on your life today and how much more of an impact it will have on all of our lives in the future
1,hacking is it's bad like um going into someone's like personal account or account changing some stuff or just stealing some information or your money yeah it's crazy they're really a lot of bad or malicious hackers out there who are doing just that they're going into people's accounts and they're stealing money but there's also another side of computer hacking where there are people who are trying to learn how those bad hackers are actually breaking in to the bank accounts did they like return the money like give them their money or something like that what they're trying to do is they're trying to even prevent the bad hackers from getting in in the first place so they put like a protection account or something yeah exactly they're looking for ways that they can create protection it's kind of like the lock on your front door that lock is to essentially prevent bad people from coming in or people accidentally coming in when they shouldn't a hacker is essentially looking at a way how can i get into this lock but then there are the good ones who are trying to unlock it so that they can tell the company that made the lock hey we can actually protect people by making the lock a little harder what would they do about the people in the broken lock in many cases they'll send them a new lock so it's an upgraded a better version sometimes that's new features but sometimes that's bug fixes and ways to protect you as well but like they may get arrested because they might get mistaken that's a very good point you should definitely make sure that you're obeying the law they might work with the lock company and say i'm trying to improve your product and they're trying to find these holes or problems and then share that with the company even though the good hacker is doing exactly the same thing as the bad hacker it's the same exact skill set and you're using the same exact techniques and information to try to break that lock but your goal is a good hacker is really to help everyone like you and me to make sure that our stuff is protected so hopefully they don't get in trouble because they're the good guys when did you start doing like the good hacking i started doing the good hacking when i turned nine years old wow i started going on the computer and playing video games but i had some ideas of my own and that's where i started to learn how to hack i wanted to play with my friends on this video game and just change the way that things look but that would be kind of like bad because maybe the creator did it for a reason that's entirely possible they may have done it for a reason but you may have come up with a really good idea that do you think there are other people who might like the idea that you came up with yeah when you have creative ideas like that hacking can actually allow you to change the way a system works and that means you can change a game and how the game is played and then you can share that with your friends and other people who like that game once i started learning how to do it i found that things that were harder for me i could make easier did your parents improve with it i don't think my parents knew but when my parents found out that i was doing it for good i think they were
2,do you do anything with computers or any coding i like to play coding games and i like to go on code.org and they have a variety of games for like different ages so like i really like to do that for example like the game flappy bird it's like puzzle pieces so they would like tell you to connect something and then you would play the game and then you could see what you connected interesting so it's like a graphical interface where you can connect different pieces together kind of like wire them together yeah oh that's pretty cool what do you know about computer hacking i don't really know much about computer hacking actually so on code.org one of the things you've been doing is actually building a game or that they have a game and then you can actually rewire some of the inputs and outputs of that is that right yeah okay with computer hacking it's actually the same thing uh really you have some sort of system and you have a bunch of inputs and you have some sort of output and actually you as the designer you're essentially designing games and software you're saying well i will only allow a user to really control these inputs can you think of any inputs the computer might have spacebar yep there's also things like your mouse and there's even things like the microphone itself is actually an input device it's it's taking something from you which is the sound and it's then transmitting that and it's actually sending it to me are there any other things that you can talk to a computer you can give it information camera that's absolutely another input that exists on your computer that's how i try to think of things is there's just a bunch of inputs often if you're trying to break something or hack something you're really saying okay how can i control these inputs in a way that wasn't necessarily expected what inputs would you normally use to hack typically it's going to be something like the keyboard right i'm just going to be typing keystrokes to be talking to some piece of software or hardware but other times it can be other things like even the temperature of a computer can actually affect how the computer operates and it might be advantageous to me to cool down the computer and actually slow down the movement of electrons in something like memory so that when a computer shuts off it stores something that was in memory like a password and stores it for longer enough time that i might be able to actually extract it through some other method how long does it take to get in it just depends what you're trying to do in some cases it could literally be seconds because you already know how the system works in other times it could be yours so what have you learned about hacking i think hacking is actually really interesting there's different languages to hack in i've also learned that a lot of things could be hacked that like you don't necessarily think that could
3,have you started studying cyber security i started this year i took my first course so haven't gone too deep into it but we got a basic idea of like basics of information and network security we learned about how networks are set up like the different type of topologies like star and mesh and also how networks are designed with different levels of security have you heard of the breach of target where they were reached many years ago and their point of sale systems were hacked yes i heard about that so where people are swiping credit cards those credit card numbers were stolen they hired a company to come in and perform a penetration test to see can the good guys essentially break in again to prevent this sort of thing in the future and when this team came in they found they actually were able to get pretty much to the same point of sale system and the way they did that was by exploiting an internet connected delhi meet scale once the company was able to essentially get into the delhi scale because the daily scale was on the internal network then they were able to really escalate privilege and find a vulnerability within another system essentially that just got them into the network and once you're in the network it's often really easy to then escalate from there i've heard about similar attacks in hospitals using hospital equipment but i'm surprised that something as simple as a meat scale would have been used in such an attack we discussed it in class as how hackers look at some of the weakest links in these large networks and use that those to tap into networks yeah that's a another interesting concept is really just different layers that we have for protection because often when you're talking about something like a corporate network or even your home network you typically have sort of one level of the defense right if someone can break that or can get in through some other system that is connected or exposes some other protocol like bluetooth right you can connect to a bluetooth device without being on the wireless network without being on the lan that potentially gives you another place that you can pivot on and then access other devices because if something has both bluetooth and also wi-fi well if you can get in through bluetooth then you can then access the wi-fi and get to other devices on the network are you familiar with buffer overflows no i'm not familiar with that if we were to write a program that asked for your name and you you typed in your name but before you could type in your name in a low level language like series c plus plus you'd have to allocate some memory so you might allocate a buffer of 100 bytes because whose name is going to be longer than 100 bytes or 100 characters but what happens if you were to not really check that they limited to 100 bytes do you know what happens if they essentially start typing over that 100 bytes in that case there it would be an error for accessing invalid memory absolutely you descent essentially cause like a segmentation fault yeah but what's really cool about that is when you're going into memory you're starting to cross over that boundary of that 100 byte allocation and now you're starting to write over additional memory that other memory is really important stuff so you have your like your name the 100 bytes there and then right next to your name is the return address and that's the address that the code is going to execute is going to return to after that function is done and it's going to jump to that address but after you type your 100 bytes the next few bytes that you type you're actually going to overwrite that return address so that return address could essentially be another address in memory so what you end up doing is you type a name and it's not really a name it's really just code and that code you keep typing until you get to the return address and you start typing an address which is really the beginning of your name and your computer your your processor is actually going to read that address and it will jump back to the beginning and then execute that payload so that was sort of the very first thing that i think was super exciting to me when i started learning about really reverse engineering so how does the buffer overloading relate to what you are doing in terms of network security or designing software for penetrating testing ever since buffer overflow started many years ago there have been a lot of protection mechanisms built to make it difficult to exploit more and more we're actually using smaller and smaller computers with small amounts of compute power if you take a car you have hundreds of microcontrollers that are all running there so they don't really have a sophisticated operating system that can try to prevent attacks like buffer overflows so how do we keep these low-cost computers in here while adding layers of protection to prevent malice and these types of attacks sometimes it actually is how can we write software or how can we build a system that prevents these types of attacks from entering but oftentimes it's really looking for how can we find new attacks that we haven't even necessarily thought of what got you interested in computer science and information security i got interested in cyber security because i'm really into global affairs global politics and you often hear in the news about the rising power of china the rising power of um iran i enjoy how interdisciplinary computer science is like nowadays there's so much going on in the world of computers and that's what fascinated me you brought up china and iran and something that's interesting about those areas is really censorship right they have essentially censored internet in the us we have a really interesting internal struggle here where we actually have uh government agencies like the state department that are funding software to evade censorship like tor and other mechanisms while then we also have an internal struggle where we have other organizations like the nsa who are specifically looking to break that exact same system that the us government is also funding there are a lot of like ethical questions about whether we should be intervening in other countries but it's pretty interesting that two different agencies at the government are actually working on contrasting technology i can actually understand that because if we are creating a technology that we're going to deploy somewhere else we should know its limitations we should know how to control it it's good for us to understand like how these systems can really break down although the i think one thing that i see is that some of let's say the organizations that are looking to break this are not necessarily going to share once they actually learn that information they might actually sort of hold that in their back pocket and use it when it's advantageous to
4,what kind of projects are you working on this is the end of my first year i'm a phd student at nyu tandon school of engineering i'm studying security systems and operating systems so security for operating systems i've been mostly working on a project that limits executables exposure to bugs in the kernel it's run by professor justin kapos there he found that the majority of bugs that occur in the linux kernel happen when you're doing things that people don't do that often that programs don't do that often so designing like a runtime environment that lets you limit what a certain program has access to but also the things that it does have access to is also limited to those popular paths in the kernel so it can't access areas that aren't under more scrutiny so essentially it's a really potentially a stripped down operating system or i guess i guess it's a virtual machine basically we're creating a user space operating system have you done any work in side channel analysis like a little bit i've like read the row hammer paper i found it really interesting but it's nothing that i've actually worked with so the side channel analysis is really looking not at vulnerability within a system but really unintended consequences of what the system is built on a very simple example of maybe site of a side channel is putting your ear to the ground to hear if their horse is coming towards you and the same thing applies to technology so you can have something like a cpu it's executing instructions certain instructions use a little bit more power and power is reserved in these capacitors which are like tiny batteries next to your cpu and as they're pulling power there's something in physics called the electro-restrictive effect where the capacitor will move in a very very tiny amount and then although we can't hear it the microphone on a mobile device can't actually listen to that if you then listen to that and you say oh i see a pattern here and you can go all the way down and then extract reveal the full password the full key even though it could be argued that the algorithm itself there's no problem with it so all memory devices are just it's just a bunch of gates and they'll they're in rows they basically all hold different pieces of memory that's all the gates are either they're turned on or they're turned off so what rowhammer found was to test a bunch of different memory devices and found that by doing a certain order of storing things and then pulling that information back in a certain way in one place would actually flip gates in a different place so that you could actually do a bunch of things to a piece of memory that had nothing to do with something that may be critical in a different place and actually change its contents and that obviously exposes all sorts of security issues um because that's that's very hard to predict yeah i suppose the physical adjacency right of the underlying transistors and capacitors that are holding that that storage that's that's crazy i think the first time i heard of an interesting attack like that was learning about uh the cold boot attack um being able to you know someone enters their password on their computer and that decrypts their hard drive and then they they walk away being able to extract that password is really difficult if i can pull that memory chip out and extract that memory put it in my own device except the problem is memory is volatile so it'll erase as soon as i pull it out you can take something like that canned air turn it upside down cool that computer make it real nice and cool then you have a minute or two to pull out the memory put it in your own device extract the memory and then you're good such a simple method to really extract something kind of critical like row hammer it's such a low level vulnerability and it's you know you could argue that it's not necessarily a vulnerability in the in the architecture itself but rather exploitation of physics at that point i've spent a decent amount of time with this stuff in my mind a lot of that is a nightmare over the last year while i was doing some other stuff i actually designed some microcontroller boards for a company that was doing stuff with like a smart watering project the problems with like updating is just like that's scares me the most like people don't update their own stuff let alone these like devices i keep forgetting to update my fridge i find myself like trying to shy away from owning like smart things that's pretty challenging if you want to use wireless right if you want to use a wireless router yeah i mean there's obviously essentials no matter what you can't really avoid any of this the risk right now just during uh this quarantine is actually massive now now that we think about it because you might have these legacy systems you know they were built 20 30 years ago and it's too costly to upgrade but now you can't actually have a lot of people in a central location in a single location so potentially they actually do have to now add some sort of remote capabilities to these systems that were never meant to be on the internet have you ever had any ethical concerns with the stuff you're interested in or the work you do oh yeah for sure when people find vulnerabilities i think it's their duty to release those to the public especially now that we're seeing more and more companies who are trying to make it illegal for you to inspect the vehicle that you've purchased right something that you actually own yeah i think that's nuts i'm i'm firmly against that for sure what if it were illegal uh would you would you then do it fortunately it's not today right it hasn't been you know that despite their attempts none of that has been passed um but if you had a vehicle and you wanted to inspect it but all of a sudden it passed i mean i don't know uh probably yeah [Laughter] no i don't think that's hurting anyone but the laws don't always equate to hurting anyone i ethically think similar to you and that you know what is moral to me is as long as i'm not intentionally hurting others right yeah i think we see every day that ethics and the laws aren't necessarily the same thing all the time
5,hey colin uh we already know each other but why don't you introduce yourself for the people watching hi i'm colin o'flynn i live in halifax nova scotia canada i do hardware hacking both in academia at dalhousie university in an industry of my startup new ae technology what have you been up to and yeah what are you working on lately i've been doing um you know always a little bit of side channel analysis so what i really do you know is all hardware layer so i've been looking uh you know on some various devices lately uh how susceptible they are to fault attacks uh what that sort of means in real life you know not just purely the the research side but also how much should you care about it uh maybe a mutual acquaintance of ours uh jasper gave an example of fault injection and i like to use that as what is like when i'm trying to explain fall injection he shows a pinball machine and the pinball machine obviously the two inputs are the plun the two plungers when you're playing a pinball machine but fault injection you can tilt the entire pinball machine right you're just introducing some external variable that's outside of the traditional inputs that you're used to and you've now controlled the environment in an advantageous way to the the user or the player can you give an example of some type of fault injection that you're doing or working on one of them was looking at like a little hardware bitcoin wallet and you could use fault injection to actually recover secrets from it um and a lot of devices i mean the whole idea is pretty cool right because you tell the device hey i want to authenticate um and it's supposed to run some really crazy math that authenticates it but instead of doing that crazy math and attacking the math you just attack the check at the end we're also scratching the surface of like what is possible it's not necessarily just the system itself and not necessarily that algorithm itself like like you said you don't necessarily need to attack the math in some cases you can just attack that check and i think something that's been pretty cool is looking at higher energy particles it's going to be maybe hard to entirely confirm but i think it'd be really really cool to actually see like i want to see one of these faults because i haven't seen it myself and also how do you know that you've seen it i've started playing with like a setting up a cloud chamber a cloud chamber lets you actually view high energy particles going through sort of like in a in a small jar with some evaporated alcohol and i thought it'd be really cool if we put some memory chip in there like a basic memory chip and we just fill it with some data but then you put a camera on that area and you just watch assuming that there is a high particle high energy particle that actually hits that memory that should potentially potentially flip the energy state of that bit the outside microcontroller should be able to read that and actually say oh wait the data changed even though i'm not changing data i'm only reading data and we should be able to visibly or optically see it what i'm wondering is could that be a next area of research because i don't think anyone's actually looking at intentionally injecting high energy particles to take over a computer when really that's what you know that's another technique for fault injection technically speaking this was actually tied into something recently i was looking at um which was you know flipping flash and eprom memory you mean flipping bits within flash yeah exactly right so flipping it in this sort of flash memory and so someone's done it with x-rays there's actually uh i forget who now there's a paper at least one and it's just like little plate right they make with like a hole in it to concentrate the x-ray source and it works like so yeah it's it's super interesting like one bit in memory means a lot especially the flash memory side yeah visualizing it would be cool though i've never seen um uh maybe call it a verifiable visualization of it right we we know it's true you know you can get skin cancer by going outside and having uh too many high and high energy particles hit you um but we've never seen it and we know it can happen to a computer chip but i've never seen like both yeah so actually so it's funny you mentioned like making it uh more obvious for state i mean staying on fault injection right now this is lately what i've been up to a lot of uh making a little kind of you know like electronics kits of old right and you can assemble it all yourself and see how it works um so making something like that for fault injection so all kind of older logic and stuff like that so um i mean it's sort of based on like you had presented the the little mux chip you know voltage glitcher that sort of idea uh using just discrete logic to generate the um the actual glitch itself so but you know it's part of i think this stuff right it's like people don't know about it sometimes like even engineers designing systems it's it's new to a lot of people the thing is even if you know about that then there's so many others that someone won't necessarily know about because there's so many i guess potential areas for for a fall to occur where do you think security is going or new research is going are any new areas you think are coming out are going to be more interesting you know pretty soon fault injection i think has become pretty interesting like there's been a lot of people poking at that and i think a lot more products of interest um side channels still might have a bit of a comeback basically what i kind of see is a lot of the really cool stuff has been in academia because product security hasn't capped up right for the longest time doing these attacks on hardware was pretty straightforward you didn't need these crazy attacks it looks like a lot of devices are coming out now that actually have real claims to security right more than just a data sheet mentioned there's actually something behind it for me i think the things that have been recent and super interesting are typically down to like physics levels effects that maybe we haven't seen before i think my mind was blown with the there was the light commands research and they were able to modulate sound although it's purely over light using a laser they would hit the mems microphone and it was picking that up and was able to then interpret it and essentially get take control over light i'm curious of the back story to how they found that uh because if you told me that right said you said like hey colin you should test this out i probably would be like i probably won't even work right which is like a lot of side channels when i first heard about it uh you know working doing firmware stuff it was like ah that sounds like it's not gonna work like that sounds impossible you know the whole area of the hardware backing it feels kind of like cheating because you know as you said someone designing the system needs to know about like so many different ways right so there's so many ways to break the system and if you're designing them you need to know like all of them but when you're attacking it you really need to know one right so i can know nothing about like how does ecc like actually work you know i have some vague hand waving i can tell you about uh but if you gave me a pen until you okay write it down specifically the equations and what they mean and how the point mall works and stuff right no idea the designers are like the other side it's almost like the i want to say lazy side of it it's the easier side i i would say my side is the easier side right i'm on the offensive side i want to break into things someone on the defense side might they might have a you know a system was developed and they now need to patch a hundred holes uh they patch 99 of them i only need to find that one yeah there's no downsides is what you're saying yeah only when you get caught i hope you learned something about hacking maybe next time a system behaves in a way that you weren't expecting you might just be curious enough to try to understand why thanks for watching
1,yes it's simple it's ver it's like a video game except it feels like you're in the video game that's actually a really good description the idea is that if you've got a system here that can make you see whatever we want you to see then we can make you believe that you're anywhere else like on top of a mountain or in a dungeon or under the ocean or in minecraft yeah or in minecraft when you look at a tv on the wall there you're showing like a picture of a mountain or something how can you tell that it's not just a window and there's something else behind it because it always doesn't look quite right if you have a static picture of a person on a screen and you move around like this it's not really changing and it's interesting those are things that we have to figure out the ways around it to fool you in virtual reality we need to figure out when you look at something in reality how can you tell whether it's real or not have you been to a 3d movie where you put on the little glasses um yeah so what they do the trick for that is if you ever at a theater and you take up the glasses and you look at it you'll see it's blurry where there's actually two pictures that they're showing at the same time and what those little glasses do is they let one eye see one picture and the other eye see a different picture so then your eyes can say oh it looks like i'm seeing right through the screen or something is floating out in front of it in the vr headsets what we do is there's actually either two screens or one screen split in half so that it draws a different picture completely different picture for each eye and we make sure that each eye can only see the picture it intended to and that's what can make things feel like they've got this real depth to them that it's something that you could reach out and touch and it doesn't feel like a flat tv screen 
2,try and look i look over there and concentrate on his face over there can you see me waving my hand without turning your eyes no all right so at some point you can probably see it right now all right so without moving your eyes this is kind of hard tell me how many fingers i'm holding up just barely tell and you see that even in like if you hold out your hand and you focus on your hand then your foot would be blurry because there's that difference there and you can change between that like you can then focus on your foot and your hand gets blurry because your eyes can see different amounts of detail in different places so we're hoping in the future that hardware can be like that where we can make a display that puts lots of detail right where you're looking and every time you look someplace else it moves the detail over to there so we don't need to render a hundred times as much as we've got right now figuring out where you're looking is a pretty hard problem what we try to go about this is by taking a camera and looking at people's eyes and then try to figure out is the eye looking over here or up here we're working hard on stuff like this right now so we hopefully can have a virtual reality that's as detailed and realistic feeling as the reality that we've actually got around us but it's going to be a long time before we get to i you know where we can really fool people so do you have a basic sense of what
3,latency is yeah so my understanding of what latency is is it's it's basically the time delay between um the rendering at different points so it's basically a delay it happens in all parts of the system monitors can be a big one like you know consumer televisions can often have 50 milliseconds or more of latency just in the tv part and then you've got the processing in the computer and all of these add up to the total latency the latency is in my opinion the most important part of vr because if you have that offset your body is no longer immersed and you get you gain that motion sickness which can pull a lot of people out of the experience games that feel really good they've got that sense of it happens instantly when you're you know when you're doing something it really is a testament to this kind of technology and how it's developing and how over time it's going to just be you're going to be able to pack more pixel density in those displays and it's going to get a lot more immersive like 30 years ago you had desktop pcs which were you spent whatever on that but there was always this idea well you can spend a million dollars and buy a super computer and it's going to be a lot faster and that's not really true today for scalar processing when you just do one thing after another a high-end overclocked cooled gaming pc is about the fastest thing in the world it is within a very small delta yeah for some things you'll get some power you know ibm power system that might be a little bit faster but not a whole lot so if i'm looking at this and saying we need to be five times faster you know what do you do you can't just say make each thing faster as a developer you're making a trade-off i can put my effort into making this more efficient or making it more fun and more fun usually wins out for very good reasons so there's some good judgment and trickery that goes into the design of things because you can always design a game that will just not work well i am i mean in the old days games had to be so precisely designed nowadays you've got a ton more freedom you really can it's just the hardware because old games are running off of 8-bit and that's all the data you can have yeah any crazy idea you do now you could probably make a pretty good video game out which is a wonderful wonderful thing yeah a lot of freedom but vr makes you have to give up a little bit of that freedom you have to not do so many crazy things so that you can wind up having it be as responsive and high quality as it needs to be that's very interesting
4,you know an interesting topic is what are the limits to what we can do with virtual reality where i'm pretty pleased with what we have today what we can show people and say virtual reality it's cool people get an amazing response from it but we're still clearly a very very long ways from reality that kind of notes back to realism in our history and how realism was response to romanticism and realism was meant to capture the mundane everyday lives of you know individuals and not idealize any of their activities in any way and i think that that's really important for virtual reality i think it's kind of like a rite of passage for any kind of our technology to go through mostly in vr we talk about the the display in optics the visual side of things but we should at least tick off the other senses and haptics is an interesting thing about virtual reality really doesn't have that aspect of touching things you can move your hands around you could do everything but it's a disconnected experience because you know you don't have you know the actual solidity there and i am pessimistic about uh progress in haptics technology about almost all other areas i'm an optimist i'm excited about what's coming up but i don't have any brilliant vision about how we're going to revolutionize haptics and make it feel like we're touching the things in the virtual world so i've you know tried the demos where there's that brla there's one that has waves like audio waves i believe that come up and then you can put your hands through that and feel the waves whenever you're supposed to be feeling bubbles or any kind of force field or something and those are pretty interesting i've seen some pretty interesting things that you could do with audios you can cut down a lot of the storage i guess in the power that you would need in order to power a huge scene you can just you know mimic the sounds of those scenes actually being there and then not actually build them out for example a professor at usc would have the sound of a train drive-by without ever actually rendering the sound and you'd feel like you're deeply immersed in this world without having to have such an expensive scene built around you so i think those are pretty you know significant and that is one potential quality improvement that's still on the horizon is when we do spatialization we use the the hrtf the head relative transfer function to make it sound like it's in different places but usually we just use this one kind of generic here as your average human hrtf function and it's possible that of course if you are right in the average then it's perfect for you but there's always people off to the extremes that it doesn't do a very good job at and there may be better ways to allow people to sample their own perfect hrtf which can improve the audio experiences a lot it all comes down to all these trade-offs you know with display and um with resolution it's one of those things where if people have one bad experience they kind of outrule everything else it's really difficult to build trust again with people um who haven't done vr before but it's easy to break off that trust whenever they do it but there was a huge concern about that at oculus and the term internally that went around was poisoning the well they were very very concerned i mean for a long time there was a fight about whether gear vr should even be done because the worry was that if we let a product go out like gear vr that didn't have those things that if somebody saw it and it was bad it made them sick made their eyes hurt then they would be like i'm never going to try vr again i tried it that time and it was you know it was terrible and there was legitimate arguments about whether it was even a good idea to do that and it turned out that yes it's obviously better to have all of those things but you can still do something that's valuable for the user without it it's weird being at the beginning of a medium like this right i'm very excited to see uh how filmmakers tackle creating content in those things especially if they're already experienced with traditional medium
5,mostly today i've been talking a lot about what can we do what's possible what we think might be possible in the next couple years but really at the professional level it's more the question of wisdom of what should we be doing that's one of the things we're trying to figure out is from an artist and story storytelling perspective kind of what are the things that will make this meaningfully different from what we're used to like a television on our wall and we've been finding a lot of things that aspects of virtual reality that very much do that in my opinion things that allow you to feel presence first and foremost where you get lost and you have to remind yourself this isn't actually happening and things that ultimately allow you to embody other characters things where you can actually change your own self-perception and play with neuroplasticity and teach yourself things that are bizarre and unique as an engineer of course i love quantifiable things i like saying here's my 18 millisecond motion to photon here's my angular resolution and i'm improving i'm doing the color space right but you can look at you know not too far back where you say we have blu-ray dvds at this amazing resolution but more people want to watch youtube videos at really bad early internet video speeds where there are things that if you deliver a value to people then these objective quantities may not be the most important thing and while i'm certainly pushing as hard as we can on lots of these things that make the experience better in potentially every way or maybe just for videos or the different things i don't think that it's necessary i've commented that i think usually my favorite titles on mobile they're fully synthetic are ones that don't even try they just go and do like light mapped flat shaded and i think it's a lovely aesthetic i think that you don't wind up fighting all of the aliasing while you get some other titles that we're gonna be high tech with our you know our specular bump maps with roughness and you've got aliasing everywhere and you can't hold frame rate and it's all problematic while some of these that are clearly you know very synthetic worlds where i it's nothing but these cartoony flat shaded things with lighting but they look and they feel good and you can buy that you're in that place and you want to know what's around that monolith over there we did a project called life of us which was exactly that mindset we were like let's embrace low-poly aesthetic and just simple vertex shading and we end up you know realizing you can embody these various creatures and transform yourself and when you do that with co-presence of another creature another human um it makes for a totally magical journey and you don't even think for a second you actually dismiss the whole idea of photo realism and embrace that reality for what it is i think it actually helps put you at ease a little bit the end goal of reality of course in computer graphics people have chased photo realistic for you know for a long time and basically we've we've achieved it photo realism if you're willing to throw enough you know discreet path traced rays at things you can generate photorealistic views we understand the light really well uh of course it still takes a half hour per frame like it always has or more to render the different things so it's an understood problem and given infinite computing power i'm we could be doing that in virtual reality however a point that i've made to to people in recent years is that we are running out of moore's law i am i mean maybe we'll see some wonderful breakthrough and you know quantum structures or whatever or bandwidth but yeah but if we just wind wind up following the path that we're on we're gonna get double and quadruple but we're not gonna get 50 times more powerful than we are right now we will run into atomic limits on our fabrication so given that i'm trying to tell people that start buying back into optimization start buying back into thinking a little bit more creatively because you can't just wait it's not going to get to that point where it really is fixed to to those highest degrees just by waiting for computing to advance if we want this to be something used by a billion people then we need it to be lighter cheaper more comfortable and there's constantly novel ux innovations like on google earth the way that they did the kind of elimination of your periphery as you zoom in and move and also giving you the user action to decide where you're going and looking there's a constantly seeing people coming up with ways to kind of break from the paradigms of actual reality and then introduce you know mechanisms that work very well you know there's tons of opportunities for the synthetic case where you want to be able to have your synthetic fantasy world where everybody is a creature that's created by the by the computer and simulated reasonably yeah but of course we've got them you know we still don't do people well simulated that's a hard problem we've been beating our heads against it for a long time i do think we're making progress and i wouldn't bet on that being solved in 10 years but maybe 20 years because it is going to take a lot of ai it's going to take a lot of machine learning where it's not going to be a matter of us dissecting all the micro expressions that people do it's going to be let's take every youtube video ever made and run it through some enormous learner that's going to figure out how to make people look realistic yeah absolutely there are these crucial thresholds where you pass you know technological hurdle and all of a sudden that unlocks a whole world of creative potential but i think to your point very much we need to solve the actual human and social challenges um and and turn those into opportunities to figure out how this technology fits into our lives i'm still a believer the magic's out there we haven't found it yet so somebody's going to you know happen upon the formula i feel like i i've felt little pockets of me yeah oh you can imagine the utility behind this for creating a world or you can imagine the power of a story that would be told you in this context and a lot of it i think is just picking those putting them together in a meaningful way and then crafting something that's that's really bigger and intentional but i've now been joining with real people in virtual reality and you i think we also have different levels of connection like the audio side is the leaps and bounds above in terms of the nuance of personality and humanity so when i hear people laughing and joking and and you know really enjoying something soon we'll get into that we're in macro gesture land where i can wave and say you know thumbs up but when we get into micro gestures and actually getting a sense of facial reactions and other things i think then we'll have a really incredibly rewarding time spending spending time with each other so vr right now is pretty amazing when you look at it it's things that you haven't seen but we are just getting started the next five years both technologically and creatively are going to really take this medium some place that you've never imagined 
1,I've been asked to explain gravity in five levels of increasing complexity gravity seems so familiar and so everyday and yet it's this incredibly esoteric abstract subject that has shaped the way we view the universe on the largest scales has given us the strangest phenomena in the universe like black holes that has changed the way we look at the entirety of physics it's really been a revolution because of gravity are you interested in science yes yes you are yes do you know what gravity is it's something that so right now there was no gravity but since there's gravity we're sitting right down on these chairs that's pretty good so gravity wants to attract us to the earth and the earth to us but the earth is so much bigger that even though we're actually pulling the earth a little bit to us you don't notice it so much you know the moon pulls on the earth a little bit just like with the ocean tides exactly the moon is such a big body compared to anything else very nearby then it has the larger effect pulling the water of the earth but more than the moon think about the Sun pulling on the earth we orbit the whole Sun just the way the earth pulls on the moon and causes the moon to orbit us all of those things are electing on you and me right now gravity was too strong will we be able to get up that's such a good question no we actually couldn't the moon gravity is weaker can almost float between footsteps if you look at the astronauts on the moon on the earth it's harder because it's bigger if you go to a bigger heavier planet it gets harder and harder but there are stars that have died that are so dense that there's no way we could lift our arms no way we could step or walk but the gravity is just way too strong do you know how tall you are I mean the force in the force maybe for three people think that while you're sleeping your body has a chance to stretch out and grab crunching you together but when you're standing and walking or sitting that gravity contracts your spine ever so slightly so that in the morning you might be a little bit taller than in the evening see if it works for you yes they say that astronauts in space definitely their spinal long gates there were two twin astronauts one who stayed here on earth and the other who went to the International Space Station it was there for a long time and when he came back he was actually taller than his twin brother yeah and that was because gravity wasn't compressing him all the time and he was floating freely in the International Space Station and his spine just kind of elongated after a while here on earth though he'll readjust they'll go back to the same size have you ever heard of how cavity was discovered Isaac Newton would ponder how does the earth cause things to fall there's a famous story that Isaac Newton was sitting under a tree and the apple fell from the tree and hit him on the head and he had an epiphany and understood this law this mathematical law for how that works I don't actually think it's a true story but it's a good story so Isaac Newton who realized that even if you're heavier you will fall at the same rate as something much lighter that that's the same once you hit the ground if you're heavier you'll hit the ground with much greater force but you will hit the ground at the same time so if we both drop down from the plane we would both wind at the same time but you would land heavier yep so like a penny from the Empire State Building will fall at the same rate as a bowling ball yeah amazing want to try it oh yeah a light object see how light that is that's very late and a heavy object they look the same but this is much heavier right okay so try it just try holding your arms out and a little higher maybe give him a chance to drop and then drop them did they fall at the same time did he hit at the same time so Isaac Newton he was also the one who realized that that's the same force that keeps the moon in orbit around the Earth on the earth in orbit around the Sun and that's a huge leap here he is looking at just things around him and then looks at the Stars and has this really big realization that that's actually the same force so what have you learned today talking about gravity I've learned that the person that learned about the Apple Newton um he was learning about gravity just about what he saw on this planet I also learned that if you drop one light thing one heavy thing at the same height at the same time they're both gonna drop at the same time but one's gonna drop a little heavier than the other that's beautiful I'm impressed so Rio you're in high
2,"studying any Sciences in high school I'm taking physics and do you think of yourself as curious about science well they're like some things that interest me and how is that for me is what it like depends what interests you well like I'm a gymnast selling in physics they talk about like force and stuff and then I think of like how I use physics and like my own life what's your impression of what gravity is I think that if there's like no gravity I really like float everywhere it like pulls things down and without it like everything would just be like chaos so you're saying gravity pulls things down yet we've launched things into space have you ever wondered how we do that that's it like a slingshot like if you put something back enough it'll to go in the opposite direction well that's true we do use slingshot technology once things are out in the solar system so for instance we use Jupiter and other planets so that when some of the spacecraft gets close it'll slingshot around and it'll cause it to like speed up but mostly around the earth gravity pulls things down so when we want to send a rocket into space and we want to go to the moon some supplies to the International Space Station the trick is to get something moving fast enough that it escapes the gravitational pull of the earth have you heard the expression what goes up must come down it's actually not true if you throw it fast enough you can actually get something that doesn't come back down again and that's basically how rocket launches work you have to get the rocket for the earth to go more than 11 kilometers a second think of how fast it is just one breath and it's gone 11 kilometers if you get it to go that fast it's not gonna come back down again so you know the International Space Station where which is orbiting the Earth that's going around the earth at like 17,000 miles an hour it has no engines anymore the engines are turned off so it's just they're falling forever so once it's out there it's not coming back down as long as it's cruising like that and like does the gravity part and it is just like in a weird way that is gravity pulling it so have you ever um had a yo-yo where you swing it around like this the string is pulling it in at all times but you've also given it this angular momentum and as long as you give it the angular momentum pulling it in actually keeps it in orbit and so the earth is pulling it in at all times so that's why it doesn't just travel off in a straight line it keeps coming back around so it's funny people think that the International Space Station is so far away that they're not feeling gravity and that's not the case at all they're absolutely feeling gravity they're just cruising so fast that even though they're being pulled in they never get pulled to the surface it's like that the roller coaster is really yeah you go in and it spins super fast and you can't feel it spinning fast yeah you feel pinned to that it's exactly like that there's something called the equivalence principle where people realized and specially Einstein that if you were in outer space in a rocket ship and it was dark and painted and it was accelerating at exactly the right rate you actually wouldn't know if you were sitting on the floor of a building around the Earth or if you want a rocket ship that was accelerating it's crazy you ever had that experience where you're sitting in a train and the other one moves and for a second you're not sure if you're the one moving yeah cuz I don't train go to school I never feel like I'm moving when I'm in the chain and I'm like wait what that's because in some sense you're really not imagine you're in this chain and it's going near the speed of light relative to the platform but it's so smooth then you should be in a situation in which there's no meaning to your absolute motion there's no absolute motion so that if you throw a ball up you might think from the outside of the platform be confused that when gravity pulls that back down it's going to hit you or something but it'll land in your palm as surely as if you were in your living room it's not kind of easy so imagine you are an astronaut you are floating in empty space so you can't see anything there's no stars there's no earth you can ask yourself am i moving just really no way for you to tell so you would probably conclude well I'm not having so then your friend marina comes cruising past you and maybe she's going thousands of kilometers a second and you say marina you're cruising it like thousands of kilometres a second you're going so fast but she had just done the same experiment she was just floating in space thinking you know am i moving there's no way to know which one of you is moving and there's no meaning to the absolute motion the only thing that's true is that you're in relative motion that's true you both agree you were in relative motion and that's clear but neither of you can say it's actually you who's moving and I'm stationary I don't even know what to say to that so let me tell you where it gets really crazy so let's say you and marina are floating in space and you can't tell who's moving let's say you both see a flash of light the flash of light comes from somewhere you don't know where so you measure the speed of light to be 300,000 kilometers per second but here comes marina and she's racing at the light pulse as far as you can tell two cars driving towards each other seem like they're going faster towards each other than somebody who's standing still relative to one of the cars right so you would say Oh marinas gonna measure a difference be like but she comes back and she's it's no 300,000 kilometers per second because from her perspective she's standing still and the laws of physics had better be the same for her the speed of light is a fact of nature that says true as the strength of gravity and the two of you are in this quandary because of one of you is the preferred person who correctly measures the speed of light that ruins everything about the idea of the relativity of motion which one of you should it be so Einstein decides they must both measure the same speed of light how could that possibly possibly be the case and he thinks well if speed is how far you travel your spatial distance in a certain amount of time then there must be something wrong with space and time and he goes from the constancy of the speed of light and a respect for this idea of relativity to the idea that space and time must not be the same for you and for marina and that's how he gets the idea of the relativity of space and time you're the best expression it's pretty wild but that is a starting point actually of the whole theory of relativity that starting point leads to this complete revolution in physics where we suddenly have a Big Bang in black holes and space-time just from that one simple starting point so is your impression of gravity different than when we started the conversation yeah cuz like I knew that like when I was on the train I didn't feel like I was moving but I didn't know like why and that it was a thing and I wasn't crazy yeah and it's really deep principle and what about the theory of gravity I don't know like usually when I just heard gravity it's like for my coaches but I didn't know like it was like all these things mm-hmm it's like a big paradigm so you're in college yeah"
3,what are you studying in college I'm a physics major so from your perspective how would you describe gravity I'm taught that it's a force it's described by inverse law but I also know that the field and there's a recent discovery with like gravitational waves although I don't like the specific details of that about that so when you say it's an inverse square law yeah that means that the closer you are yeah the more strongly you feel the gravitational pull yeah that makes sense yes very few things that are stronger when you're further apart yeah so you can also think of a gravitational field something that permeates all of space the earth three stories below us it's not as though it's pulling at us from a distance right we're actually interacting with the field at this point and there's a real interaction right here at this point and that's nice because people were worried that if things acted at a distance yeah that the way the old fashioned inverse-square force law describes it that it was as spooky as like mind-bending a spoon that it was like telekinesis you know if you don't touch something how do you affect it and so the first step was to start to think of gravity as a field that permeates all of space and it's weaker very far from the earth and it's stronger very close to the earth so one way to think of this field is as a field that's really describing a curved space-time that is everywhere forget the difficulty of the math just the intuition comes from two kind of simple observations one was what Einstein described as the happiest thought of his life so right now you might feel heavy in your chair and we might feel heavy on the floor in our feet or standing in an elevator cab and Einstein would have said what does it chair you have to do with it or the floor or the elevator those aren't gravitational objects and so he wanted to eliminate them and one way to do the thought experiment is to imagine standing in an elevator that you can't see out of a black box and imagine the cable is cut and you and the elevator begin to fall so I'm free fall you're in total free fall now because things fall at the same rate yeah including the elevator and you yeah you can actually float in the elevator if you just float it in the elevator the two of you would drop and you might not even know it you're falling you can take an apple and drop it in front of you and it would float in front of you you would actually experience weightlessness it's called the equivalence principle it was Einstein's happiest thought that what you're really doing when you're experiencing gravity isn't being heavy in your chair it's falling weightlessly in the gravitational field and that was the first step to think of gravity as weightlessness and falling I know like as your gravity experienced you're done with planes Emily yeah exactly yeah you can make somebody look like they're in the International Space Station by flying up in a plane and then just free-falling the plane just drops out of the air and while it's falling they will float weightlessly and there's been a lot of experiments about it but you don't want it to end unhappily so the play has to scoop back up yeah and then you see them become pinned to the floor of the ball okay because then the plane is interrupting their fall so that's the first thought and then the next is what is the shape that's changed so if you are floating in empty space really empty space yeah and you had an apple and you threw the Apple what shape do you think it would chase the path well if I threw it straight I would think it would go it's straight yeah it would just go straight but if you did that on the earth what would happen it would just go down yeah but it would call it with tracing curved oh yeah Jason Hart yeah and the faster you throw it you look kind of longer the arc so the second step to thinking about curved spacetime is to say that when things fall freely around a body like the earth they trace curved paths as those space-time itself space itself was curved and so so that's the intuition that's how Einstein gets from thinking that space-time is curved from the idea that well there's just field that permeates all of space and what it's really describing is the curves that things fall along and from there it's a very long path to finding the mathematics and the right description that's really hard but that intuition is so elegant and so beautiful and just comes from these two simple thought experiments that's amazing isn't it kind of a so you described learning in a class about light the theory of special relativity or Einstein is really adhering to the constancy of the speed of light and questioning the absolute nature of space and time and it seems like that has nothing to do with gravity but he later begins to think about the incompatibility of gravity with his theory of relativity so suppose the Sun were to disappear tomorrow from like evil genius comes and just figures out a way to evaporate the Sun in Newton's understanding of gravity we would instantaneously know about it all the way over here at the earth and that's incompatible with the concept that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light no information not even information about the Sun could possibly travel faster than the speed of light so we shouldn't know about what happened to the Sun for a full eight minutes which is the time it would take light to travel to us and so he begins to question why gravity is so incompatible with relativity but he already knows he's thinking about space and time in relativity so then he gets to his general theory of relativity where he realizes if I eliminate everything but just the gravitational field of let's say the earth and I look at how things fall and I see that they follow curves well then he realizes that space and time don't just contract or dilate that they can really warp that they can bend him that they can curve and then he finds a way to make gravity compatible with relativity by saying if the Sun were to disappear tomorrow the curves that the Sun imprinted in space-time would actually be into ripple and those are the gravitational waves and they would change and they would flatten out because the Sun was no longer there yeah that would take the light travel time to get to us to tell us that the Sun was gone uh-huh and then we would stop orbiting and just travel along a straight line Wow Wow so what do you think you walk away with what do you think you learned well more about the intuitions behind the concept because we already just do with the problems but sometimes you get lost in a math but like speaking like this it's really helps build my intuition yeah it just it does for me too so thank you
4,so you're getting your PhD in physics that's right theoretical high-energy physics basically the physics of really really small fundamental things so what would that have to do with gravity or astrophysics well what I'm looking at is states of matter that might exist inside neutron stars so when a star dies if the star is massive enough there's a huge explosion called a supernova and the stuff that's left behind that doesn't get blown away collapses into a tiny compact blob called a neutron star so what I love about neutron stars personally is that they're kind of City sized that's right about the size of a city so you're imagining something more than the mass of the Sun yep or about the mass of a Sun condensed to the size of a city it's dense enough that one teaspoonful would weigh about a billion tons here on earth no that makes the gravitational field incredibly strong that's right around the neutron star so what would happen if we were on a neutron star because we would immediately be crushed into the ground I think our bodies would be shred into their subatomic particles so what's the connection between neutron stars and black holes so as I understand it a black hole sort of like a neutron stars big brother it's more intense if you have so much matter when a star is collapsing that it can't hold itself up it collapses to a black hole and those are so dense that space-time breaks down in some way or another black holes are so amazing that where the neutron star stops and there's something actually there right there's a material there if it's very heavy it becomes a black hole so it keeps falling once the event horizon of the black hole forms which is the shadow the curve that's so strong that not even light can escape the material keeps falling and like you said maybe space-time breaks down right at the center there but whatever happens the star is gone that black hole is empty so in a weird way black holes are a place and not a thing so is there a sensible way to talk about what's inside a black hole or is that should you think of it as there is no space-time there isn't a sensible way to talk about it yet and that probably means that's where Einstein's theory of gravity as a curved space-time is beginning to break down and we need to take the extra step of go took some kind of quantum theory of gravity and we don't have that yet so even though the black hole isn't completely understood we do know that they form astronomically that in the universe things like neutron stars form and things like black holes form the consequences are very much speaking to this curved space-time so for instance of two black holes orbit each other they're like mallets on a drum and they actually cause space-time to ring and it's very much part of gravitation the ringing of space-time itself we call gravitational waves and that's what's what's something Einstein thought about right away in 1915 1916 he was thinking about that those waves are very exciting for me too because neutron stars orbiting each other also give off gravitational waves and we might be able to get some data about neutron star material from that kind of signal yes the ring space-time also like a drum and you can record the sound of that ringing after a billion years when it's traveled through the universe but then the next thing that happens is those neutron stars collide and because of this incredibly high energy state of matter which you study it becomes this firework of different explosions it's really quite spectacular that's right in fact when we recorded that for the first time with gravitational waves we then pointed telescopes at it and were able to see it optically as well and that gave scientists a lot of data yeah it was um to my knowledge the most widely studied astronomical event in the history of humanity Wow so where the gravitational waves were recorded and they realized oh this sounds like you can reconstruct the shape and size of the mallets of the drum from the sound these sounds like neutron stars colliding not black holes and so like you said there was a trigger for satellites and experiments all over the world to point roughly in the direction that the sound was coming from so from your point of view I mean they're like two superconducting giant magnets colliding an experiment you could never do on earth that's just of the most tremendous scales and peculiarities of matter absolutely I've heard statistics like many earth masses worth of gold or created forged in the yeah a neutron star collision that that we used to think that most elements in the universe were created in supernovae which is when stars explode because there's so much violent activity at the center that you need that kind of energy to create new elements the way you do in a bomb it's basically nuclear fusion sure but we now think that that kind of fusion happens when two neutron stars collide if you think about it you have two massive blobs of neutrons when you smoosh them together you've got neutrons colliding it creates the conditions where new elements can be created that's amazing it's literally populating the periodic table yes we now think that most of the heavy elements after some number are created in neutron star collisions so you are already a PhD student you know a lot about gravity but what do you think you've taken away from this conversation well I've definitely taken away that the way that we think about gravity today is very different from how Newton thought about it and that even though we have a very good understanding there's lots of things that we don't fully understand there's still a lot of questions to be answered which i think is really exciting see you're a scientist isn't the best part being able to ask the questions oh yeah
5,so we've been talking about gravity from Newton and celestial bodies the earth the moon pulling on each other in the conventional sense of gravity being an attractive force to the earth creating curves in space-time then we moved on to just diffuse seeds of energy and space-time as the real universe and gravitation is really just talking about space-time in general and here we are and you're really hardcore in theoretical physics where would you take the exposition of gravity from that point well one thing is quantum mechanics quantum mechanics it's the most accessible theory in the history of science it explains the most different phenomena the most precisely yet many people would still say we don't understand even the basics of it so when we think about quantum mechanics we think about particles and their quantum charges and in the Fineman way the way that Fineman taught us you know come in and they exchange a forest carrier and then they come out again so that's how we think of an electron and light scattering for instance or something like that and the language that Einstein gave us is so different it's completely geometric it's all of this space-time and it's also unnecessary yeah for me the the beauty of the theory of gravity is is the way Einstein formulated it as a theory of geometry of curved space and time I think like you that's one of the things that really pulled me into it is there really space-time or are we just using unnecessary language because it's elegant and we like it and it's beautiful well I think there is really space time in the sense that it's a description that works really well so there has to be something right about it I mean if we're gonna talk about what's really really underlying that yeah and we're gonna put quantum mechanics into the mix then there should be some quantum mechanical wave function for space 9 you should be able to take two different space times and add them together because one of the crazy things about quantum mechanics as you know is its together yeah any two states any two possible states of the world you can just literally put a plus sign between them and that's a that's a sensible state that's a good state make sense so do you think there's some sense in which we shouldn't be thinking about individual universes individual space-time so we should be thinking about superposition subspace please yeah think so I think if you were to go far enough back in the history of the universe back to when it was very very dense very small and when quantum mechanics was certainly important then it must have been like that I mean if we believe that the dominant standard model of cosmology something had to produce the density perturbations the things that seeded all the galaxies and stars and us everything else in the world so there's a galaxy over there let's say and not over there so how did that happen why is there galaxies they are not there in the standard theory as you know that was a quantum event a random event yeah and it doesn't mean that it happened they're not there because you flipped a coin it actually happened in both places there's got to be a wavefunction where in one branch of the wave function is galaxies they're not there and any other branch it's the opposite so when we're talking about the multiverse or the Big Bang we are really talking about gravity ultimately and we're talking about how a theory of gravitation which we now think of as a theory of space-time has a quantum explanation has a quantum paradigm imposed on it that will help us understand these things and we don't have that yet one of the things that I think is so amazing is that the terrains in which we're going to understand quantum gravity are very few right it's the Big Bang because that's where we know that quantum and gravity both were called into action and there's black holes one of the most interesting discoveries of course Hawking's discovery kick-started a kind of crisis right in thinking about why quantum mechanics and gravity were so knocking heads it was one of the most beautiful examples sure yeah it's it is a beautiful beautiful idea so first of all to be totally clear that we've never observed Hawking radiation which is what he predicted directly I don't think very many people doubt that it's there but yeah how can you discover it mathematically that's when you have a black hole it's got an event horizon it's got a surface which is a point of no return if you fall through that surface no matter what you have no matter how powerful of a rocket you got even if you beam a flashlight back behind you in the direction you fall from nothing escapes not even like it all gets sucked in and spaghettified and destroyed at the singularity or something something happens it doesn't get out but in quantum mechanics you can't really pin down the location of something for cisely if you try to pin down an electron and a tiny circuit and a microchip sometimes you discover that it's not actually there and then your computer crashes this is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in reality you can't precisely say where the electron is and you can't precisely say how quickly it's moving exactly yeah so when you get the blue screen of death that might be because of quantum physics you know you try to pin something down near a black hole well it's a surface it's got a particular radius for a round black hole and you want to say something is inside or outside well you can't absolutely say that quantum mechanics and this kind of uncertainty produces a radiation which you can think of as pulling some of the energy out of the black hole the black hole was formed out of some mass and there's an energy in that you can think of pulling some energy out of that and sending it off to infinity in the form of particles being emitted yeah and what Hawking found is that it's a thermal spectrum it looks like a hot or not so hot for a large black well but like an oven the kind of radiation that comes out of it cast iron this idea that the darkest phenomena in the universe actually is forced to radiate quantum particles it's pretty wild I think everyone understood that the that it was a correct calculation but I don't think a lot of people understood the implications that it meant something really terrible was happening because this black hole which could have been made of who knows what is disappearing into these quantum particles which in some sense have nothing to do with the material who went in so do you think that's a big crisis the black hole evaporates the information is lost it's a crisis because of some of the details of it but I would say the way you just described it I mean if I build a big bonfire or an incinerator and I throw an encyclopedia into it good luck reconstructing what was in that inside information is lost for all practical purposes practical fair yes so this is a huge crisis because either quantum mechanics is wrong and as you described it's the most accurately tested paradigm in the history of physics how could it be wrong right or the event horizon is letting information out and violating one of the most sacred principles of relativity one thing about quantum mechanics is that anytime you have a state of the world and another state of the world you can you can literally add them together and get a third possible status raises that sounds and so if you're going to have a quantum theory of gravity then we can't really talk about there being a black hole or not a black hole hmm right or an event resident or not oh this isn't because we could always take a state that had an event horizon and a state that doesn't or has the event horizon in a slightly different position maybe and add them together so the existence or position of an event horizon can't possibly be you know determined as a fact anymore than the position of electron is determined so I think that's the loophole that's a nice way of looking at it so that you're not actually violating classical relativity once you're in a regime where the wavefunction has really peaked around a very well-defined stage that's right I'm whatever one of the most exciting developments in the last 10 or 20 years is called holography and it's called holography because a hologram is a two-dimensional surface it's a three-dimensional image it's got sort of 3d information built into it right and this in a fundamental way really has that freedom for a higher dimensional information built into it yeah it's exactly the same as this theory of gravity in more dimensions yeah so one of the things I like to think of it with holography is that I can pack a certain amount of information about Cole I mean you can literally think of as like storing things into it let's say I have information and some volume and I'm under the illusion that I could just keep packing information in that volume as much as the volume will contain eventually I'll make a black hole and I'll find out what the maximum amount of information I can pack into anything in the entire universe is what I can pack on the area right and since areas projecting the illusion maybe a volume maybe the whole world is just a hologram it's not a principle that only applies to black holes it's saying that if this theory of quantum gravity is correct then this whole three dimensionality is an utter illusion and really the universe is two-dimensional and as practice speaking you mentioned before in a conversation that it's really interesting the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a practical limit now and microchips yeah and if we make microchips much much smaller than they already are even as they already are it causes errors because you don't know that bad Johnson if holography if this limit on how much information you can ever pack if that ever became a limit as far as we know that's an absolute limit right we started off with with clay tablets not so much information yeah okay yeah but then we had written stuff it's getting better and psychic videos with thin paper that's even better CDs dancer interns renovation eventually make a black hole at some point you try to fill up your encyclopedia with knowledge and the most knowledge you ever have would only be a two-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface right and as big as the universe and then you're done yeah so you know it's not likely that we're gonna hit that limit any time soon do you think it's possible that gravity is really ultimately just quantum mechanics and doesn't exist at all in the fundamental ways that we've been talking about so far like the Newtonian way and the space-time way that those are just these kind of macroscopic illusions and sometimes I talk about in terms of temperature temperature it's not a thing there's no single thing called temperature right it's a macroscopic illusion that comes from the collective behavior really quantum behavior of random motions of atoms and is it possible at the whole of gravity is like some kind of emergent illusion from what's really quantum phenomena underlying it well if we buy the idea of holography then absolutely that's for sure that's what that's what it's telling us although which side is the illusion and which that is the reality right they're the same I mean temperatures still great to talk about doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about temperature I mean we should absolutely adjust your thermostats and talk about temperature but if we look at it closer and closer and closer we realize there's not a thing in the world that has a quantum value temperature yeah isolated and so maybe there is no such thing as gravity isolated from quantum mechanics right so I guess with the holographic description we've got two sides which are which are actually secretly the same on one side there's definitely not gravity on the other side well it's a quantum theory of gravity whatever that means but the point is you can get it out it's equivalent to this neighborhood definite so that's like just saying there's the the idea of a dual description is just saying there's a perfect dictionary between these two descriptions and so to believe or which ones real is silly it's like saying as French wheeler is English we all right yeah oh I like to give is if you take some extra dimensions and you compactify them let's say just one all that is it's exactly equivalent to whatever particles you had whatever fields you had in your original theory before you rather you just add an infinite Tower of new particles with certain properties that are all easy to calculate for me it's a question of which one which description is most useful I mean if you want to say gravities and it's all quantum that's great but then you fall down the stairs and bang your head like this description that works pretty well you don't go to the doctor about certain defensible cost plus you raise a fluctuation so there's so many open questions the fact that there are all these fundamental issues that we really don't understand but on the other hand there's all of these moving parts that fit together so neatly there's definitely something that's working here but ultimately what is going to emerge from that what structures lying under it we just don't know but I think the fact that there are so many fundamental questions that we just don't know the answer to that it's an opportunity that's exciting it's great thanks so much for coming thank you good to have you here thank you very much John it was my pleasure I hope you learned something about gravity you hadn't thought of before and I hope even more that it provoked some questions so thank you for watching 
1,hey tegan do you know what we're here to talk about today science we are here to talk about science we're here to talk about something called crispr have you heard of that no crispr is a tool that scientists are using to edit or change genomes do you know what a genome is no it's kind of like an instruction manual the instruction manual that makes you who you are sometimes there's mistakes in the instruction manual like people get sick like allergies like allergies do you have do you have friends at school that have allergies well i have allergies penicillin and azithromycin their type of medicine it's good that you actually know exactly what you're allergic to for people that have really severe allergies we could erase where in that in that big instruction manual where they have those allergies and maybe make it so they don't have those allergies anymore blowing my mind [Laughter]
2,do you know what crispr is absolutely not no not at all crispr is a way to edit the genome do you know what a genome is yeah it's the dna dna is kind of the language that the genome is written and the genome itself is an instruction manual it describes how to make you how tall you should be what color hair you have or what color eyes you have so what crispr is and an easy way to think about it it's like a molecular pair of scissors that can go through that long long genome and find specific places make small cuts and edit it what do you think about being able to edit genomes it's actually kind of cool because then you could change can't you technically change things about a person if you edit the dna sure so how do we determine what's what's the right uses then i don't think it should be used for almost cosmetology reasons like for people just be like oh i want to be five foot six instead of five foot four or like reasons that aren't necessarily the most informed i just think if it could genuinely help someone like if someone had cancer and there was a way to fix it or like slow down the growth so a lot of the work that we do in my lab is about being engineers of dna we try and look to see what mutations cause diseases and to see if when we change those mutations if we can take a sick cell or organism and make it healthy again couldn't you technically because the p53 when it's defected does that's what causes cancers p53 is the most common mutation in cancer that's that's right yeah that's a great idea actually to use crispr to target tumor cells and restore p53 to fix that that mutation so to make that cut with these scissors and fix it
3,have you heard about crispr yes this revolutionary gene editing tool i know there have been uh previous gene editing tools but christopher is more revolutionary in that it's more precise and a little bit more affordable do you know how crispr works so it works where you have this crisper what this cast 9 complex um protein calcium protein cas9 protein complex along with something called a guide rna that's right that's right and that rna will basically tell this protein where to go and what gene to sort of cut out right and this is what makes the crispr system very programmable is that the little piece of guide rna is easy to make right we can program crispr to go to many different places in the genome quite easily but i've heard they're like close to almost curing muscular dystrophy with it but there's a lot of i guess ethical issues that come up with it too one of the really nice things actually about crispr is that we can use it in human cells you know if you ask most people should you use it to cure cancer most people would say yeah those those are good good uses but there are other areas that are a little bit more problematic like editing the germline which means something that could be passed on ethics-wise a lot of people will have that natural reaction of fear against something new because it has a lot of potential and we just don't know where it can take us yet it was sort of similar to like when people started doing in vitro fertilization test two babies that was the kind of scare term exactly exactly but now we see it's perfectly fine as long you know it's regulated and plenty of people i know some people who came up from that
4,so there's been a lot of talk about using crispr for gene editing in humans and that that can be a controversial thing i think very naturally there's many aspects of ethics that need to be looked at firstly if we're talking about using crispr are we using it in somatic cells such as t cells or are we using it in embryos or germ stem cells and the issue with that is now you're modifying the genome at a germline level any unintended consequences could go forward many generations you're saying with germline sure there's unintended consequences but there's also lack of consent if you are not around you can't consent exactly so these future generations or products of crispr they can't consent another i think ethical component is if crispr does make it to market who will have access to it is that going to be cost prohibitive will only a certain select few be able to use it as many new cancer drugs are today right right will that be how it is yeah would people start using it for non-therapeutic reasons and i think this then can get into a whole slippery slope so i think a lot of people are concerned maybe that crispr will be used in kind of frivolous ways maybe just to choose somebody's eye color or or how tall they are what color hair they have and i think what a lot of people don't realize maybe is that the state of genetics is not quite there it's nice to think that i can go in and choose exactly what eye color i want but fundamentally science doesn't exactly know all of that yet we don't know every single gene related to eye color nor the regulatory mechanisms nor the epigenetics this is a right so so we can use crispr now to try and understand better how do our genes relate to these these different features these different phenotypes that that we have there's a lot of work left to do before we even know what i think what are the knobs and dials what are the controls right that you know affect eye color or how tall you are so i think this question right now even though it's important to discuss i kind of feel like it's more theoretical right now yeah or is it really even a point necessary for conversation because people are going out every single day and getting plastic surgery to change how they look how is this any different and in the same slant people are using in vitro fertilization right so this is manipulating genomes you're choosing which embryos to implant so we're almost doing little aspects of what crispr has the potential to do
5,so matt what are you doing right now in the lab and how are you using gene editing in your own work right now one of the questions i've been very much interested in is trying to understand the effect of human genetic variation on using crispr cas9 reagents because you and i just sitting here differ in millions of different locations within our genome we use these guide rnas which are 20 base pairs and we match it to different places in the genome but what if there's a mutation at that site and how does that affect a mutation that's different between you and me it's the same site but there's a slight difference in the dna between you and me exactly let's say in you it's a perfect match and me there's one that's actually a mismatch and how does that affect things in the lab because maybe it won't be as efficient it won't be able to bring cas9 to the correct site and cut there so when when people are using crispr now in the lab are they really sequencing the exact cell type they use sequencing reading out the genome of that cell before they use crispr not many do that it would ultimately be the best way to do it for sure because the reference genome that was published in 2001 was kind of just one person's genome and as we know very well from sequencing many different individuals there are a lot of differences and so there are some concerns that when you use these in the lab that you're intending for a cut to be made in this one place in the genome but if there happens to be a mismatch there because of some variant in the cells that you're studying maybe it won't cut there at all and even maybe worse is that maybe it'll cut somewhere else because maybe now it can match elsewhere so so you're saying right now that it's it's kind of early days with crispr and that there's a lot of technical issues that really need to be ironed out that it's not anything can be targeted at any time we're trying to develop the scientific steps that will take us to that kind of total genome control it is still the early days and as much progress has been done which is actually quite remarkable given how new this technology is i mean we're just a few years away from when it was really started being used for these applications however having said that holds a lot of potential and i think can get there but there's a lot of issues and concerns that need to be worked out i was going to say that a lot of what inspired me to get into bioengineering are movies movies like jurassic park which both shows the good and the bad sides of manipulating the nature around us and so maybe it's a bit of a silly question but what do you think in our lifetime will we see something like jurassic park where humans have actually engineered uh different different animals anything is possible i'm not sure that we will see that in our lifetimes but i would be very excited to attend jurassic park if that were the case having said that i do think that crispr cast 9 does have a lot of potential to do things that are kind of out of the box in the past few years we've been able to tackle ideas that people didn't even think were possible before that more than anything crispr has created a whole open field of opportunities and so whether or not that leads us to jurassic park i can't tell you that answer for sure but i certainly hope that it does i think you're right that the opportunities might be much broader than just biomedical science it might be things like using dna as a hard drive being able to uh use crispr as a diagnostic instead of just a tool for for editing can we yeah use cells to record data over time with with crispr can we use crispr to track cells in a developing embryo i think this is one of the most exciting recent uses of crispr i've seen that i would have never predicted a year ago the dominant paradigm right now is crispr is just for cutting dna but when you think of it more as a general platform a pointer to a location in a genome then that becomes a very very powerful thing do you think crispr will be helpful for understanding human variation beyond what we already have just by sequencing people's genomes yes absolutely i think that the real power of crispr lets us to follow up on this genetic information that we've been studying and following for a very long time now there's been a lot of studies where you take a group of people with disease x and people without that disease and you see if any mutations seem to be preferentially in the group with the disease and kind of absent in the group without the disease people have observed these differences but what you're saying is with crispr we can now test is this causal this factor if we make this mutation does it cause the disease does it either create sickle cell anemia or ameliorate sickle cell anemia and prevent it do you think we'll ever be at a place where based on looking at someone's genome and these kinds of crispr functional screens we can predict what kinds of diseases these people might get 10 20 years in the future i think that's certainly a great goal as of now we tend to focus on variants or mutations that we know the function what about mutations we've never seen before something that comes from let's say uv radiation and melanoma or something i think that we will ultimately have the power to do that and so thinking about when you start from mutation do you look at the expression of rna is that change is it changing things at the protein level so so this is interesting so you mentioned that we can analyze genomes the dna level and then you said the rna level looking at the expression of genes and then the proteins the products that they actually make with proteomics or mass spectrometry but do you think it's kind of like another level of understanding the function of the genome or do you view it as part of one one of those those levels i do think it provides a different level of data the ability to rapidly and genome-wide assess and make changes at the dna level and then look at the resulting changes of the rna and protein level i think is something that we haven't been able to do and is now i think going to rapidly advance understanding at a genetic level at the dna level of a lot of different diseases so so you and i have done functional screens we've done these large-scale crispr screens where we modify many genes thousands of genes or thousands of locations in the genome all in kind of a test system but do you ever see this one day the idea of these multiplex pooled crisper screens going into the clinic that we actually take a clinical cell line a cell line from a patient absolutely i think that is kind of one of the ultimate goals ultimately it would be very nice to be able to correct the mutations for these diseases we've known about for sometimes hundreds of years and we just haven't been able to do anything about there's a lot of kind of ethical issues surrounding very reasonably using crispr in the clinic i think there's a lot of concern about trying to use crispr technology other genome technologies to make humans designed in a specific way whether you want to change eye color height or things like that the kind of irony of that situation is that the genetics of a lot of the traits that are you know you can see by just looking at a person are quite complex and are not worked out in the same way so you're saying that the ethical problem is not really right now a clear and present issue because for many of these perhaps a little bit more superficial traits that we have we don't really even know what what genes can control these these traits though it's probably a good idea to start thinking a little bit about engineering somatic cells versus germline cells which are passed on to future generations and i think one nice thing is that most scientists agree that for at least for human gene editing that we need to focus on somatic cells which really impacts a lot of people with these diseases and that there's many many issues around editing the germline where there you're doing something that might be inherited for for many many generations so it's it's kind of an interesting misconception that people think that crispr is just one thing just one enzyme cas9 i think that's a really great point and that speaks to just how fast this technology is developing because it started with us just knowing about cast nine but in just one cast nine right s pyogenes cas9 was kind of the first one used for gene editing in human cells exactly and just in the past few years this this toolbox has now been expanded well past that for example you can look into other different species of bacteria to find cast iron so cas9 is over many different species it's over a tremendous amount of bacteria and so you would reference strep page nice cas9 well if they you look into staphylococcus aureus you can also find cast 9 and that cast line is just slightly different it can target different regions of the genome and so that opens up a whole new set of possibilities in terms of genome editing so it increases the targetable space within the human genome you can target more regions that you couldn't with that first first cast line and what i find actually is a really interesting thing is that there's this huge metagenomic diversity of different crispr systems and most of them are really just not even well characterized yet and i think the best example that we were talking about earlier is this new rna targeting crispr so instead of cutting dna it targets rna and i think this is just one example of a complete paradigm shift i don't think anyone had necessarily predicted at the beginning that this would be one of the things that just was created and existed in nature and it just took some time for people to uncover it i think it's a great good example of why it's important actually to fund basic science because you sometimes when you start down a certain path you never know where you're going to end up in the end the more research that can be done in this area can really unleash new possibilities finding new things different versions of cas9 or other things that function like cast nine or things completely different that at this moment i can't even think of the possibilities are endless to be a little cliche about it no literally i think they are endless for sure i think it's great for people of all ages to understand crispr and at least a little bit about genome engineering because so much of the world today revolves around biology also there's something about self-understanding we really want to understand ourselves and what makes up ourselves and crispr and gene editing is another way to get at what is the substance underlying us
1,Christopher hey Christopher and how old are you I'm 10 what great is that I think fifth think what is your favorite subject in science well that's awesome because we're gonna be talking about science today cool hey you know we're gonna be talking about what sleep of the day mine too cuz I get to spend all day studying it cuz you know what sleep does for you body's like an electric car that's exactly right it kinda is like recharging your battery right and sleep is so critical for so many parts of our body in our mind right it plays a really important way that we learn and it helps us kind of recover from the day before it affects our immune system and our metabolism all of these things that we need to kind of be healthy so today we're gonna talk about some animals and how they sleep so here's the first one what's that a giraffe have you ever seen a giraffe in person oh they're pretty cool right huh and so what's really cool about this is that giraffes need to sleep like everybody else and so the way that it does is it kind of kind of slumps over and it gets down on its legs and it kind of becomes this ball but what's crazy about the whole thing is they only sleep for like 30 minutes a day 30 minutes because it can't waste any more time because it can't be vulnerable for any longer it can get eaten by lions and that kind of thing it is kind of evolved in a way that it can still survive and still get all the restoration it needs under such a short period of time like recharge really humans so we think it works the same way but maybe just like more efficiently and so we're still really learning about how this works sleep science itself is kind of a new field I had to sleep over on Saturday and I didn't sleep at all and how did you feel tired really tired do you think you were a little crankier than usual yeah that's actually really interesting because what happens is humans and everything needs to sleep eventually and so you can't stay up indefinitely right what do you think happens if you don't sleep it affects what you can do in your daily life excellent so now I want to tell you about another animal and how they sleep okay so we have this one what's that a hippo hippopotamus they have a different challenge they sleep underwater right right so how do they do it in the in the area that they live they need to stay cool right and so they spent a lot of time in the water and so then as a consequence they need to sleep in the water but how do they do it so it's really fascinating what they do is while they're sleeping they actually float back up to the surface and breathe without waking up they're able to go about their whole sleep cycles but still able to breathe because their body has adapted in a way that they can still get the oxygen that they need it's it's it's a really amazing thing what do you think that's cool would it be cool to have that power oh yeah so now I want to talk about our last animal and I think this one is probably the most amazing of all okay so what's this oh I don't think a dolphin yes so dolphins kind of like hippos have to sleep in the water okay but because they're mammals right they need to breathe dolphins breathe air they have to go up to the surface and breathe right and for an animal like that it can get eaten it needs to figure out a way that it can sleep but also still survive right you know what how dolphins sleep one half of their brain at a time so half of their brain goes to sleep and the other half stays awake so that they can continue to breathe and swim and they do it in this for hours at a time so like their right part of their brain sleeps they're able to go up to the surface and breathe then the left part of their brain sleeps for four hours and it goes back and forth back and forth so that they can kind of maintain alertness still breathe and survive is that amazing or what that's cool so what'd you learn today I learn how other animals sleep what is important about sleeping sleep rests your body and you have to rest your body in order to do your daily things in life
2,hey I'm Eric I'm doing nice teacher and how old are you doing I'm 16 years old okay where do you go to school MacLaren's high school in Oakland California excellent and what's your favorite subject ap chemistry that's a serious scientist and good news we're talking about science today yeah in fact we're talking about sleep and sleep science do you sleep I do I try you try but we all gotta try you've probably heard about sleep as this kind of you know it's a biological process that happens in your brain it's really important to your body but it's it's a lot more complex than that sleep is made up of different parts and you know when you think about sleep what do you think about resting relaxing really shutting down your brain taking some time off and a busy schedule and you know a work day but being off is just not being off there's lots of things that are happening we're gonna kind of talk about those different pieces of sleep okay so our sleep is is made up of different types okay the first one is called non rapid eye movement sleep or non REM okay or n REM and then the other one which is you know might not be a surprise it's called REM rapid eye movement sleep and those are the the two main types of sleep that happen the way that we measure that as a sleep scientist is we actually will bring people into the lab or they can do this at home where we put electrodes on their scalp while they're sleeping and then allows us to measure the brain activity that's going on during the night okay are you like able to tell how much sleep someone's getting or what their sleep schedule is by REM when we measure all of that we're able to see you know how much time someone's asleep and how many how many times they wake up and stuff during the night you know we're also really interested in kind of the amount of non REM sleep that someone gets and the amount of REM sleep that someone gets because each part of those types of sleep do different things for the body and so it's important to get both of those and so within non REM sleep there are three stages ranging from n1 to n2 to end so not particularly clever in our naming but that's how we know what stages they are and what they do is as it moves from lightest to deepest sleep okay and so an n1 it's more kind of light wakefulness sleep kind of kind of in and out of sleeping then you go into n2 which is where we spend 45 to 55 percent of our sleep and it's it's more this kind of light sleep but then we get into kind of the the really restorative sleep and that's n3 and in n3 when we look at someone's eg wave we see these big slow waves and it's called slow wave sleep and so we spend about you know 20% of our sleep and in slow wave sleep though it can vary on a day to day ok when do you think you experience the most of Rama well I've heard that you don't really go in till I could deeper sleep so I'm guessing like in 3 or any of the ends that are really if you are on technology right before you go to sleep and also if you like if there's so much light or if you are listening to music while you're asleep or anything like that like you're not experienced with deep sleep right you know some of that is is totally accurate that like you know when you your brains more engaged by being on your phone or you know doing things that you really enjoy or things that stress you out or any of those types of things it's harder to get to sleep and to kind of fall into that deeper levels of sleep most of the REM sleep this dreaming sleep happens in the second half of the night okay so we wake up a lot during the night and we just don't remember it and then you'll go back down into deep sleep and then you know up again into REM and you know and the kind of these these cycles right do you ever take naps I do okay how long that how long are the naps that you take anywhere between 1 to 6 hours 1 to 6 hours yes that's a long nap ok usually we want to keep naps like like 20 or 30 minutes when people drop into deep sleep and then they're walkin up out of a nap most people report that they feel way worse than they did before they took the nap and that's because you've been in deep sleep and it's this term called sleep inertia so what are what are the stages of sleep so in one being like light you know sleep still a lot of brain activity going I can imagine that that happens right after you fall asleep asleep and into being light moderate activity in your brain still sleep but still kind of consciously aware and then 3 being the deepest form of sleep I want to know if you agree sleep is the coolest thing you've ever heard of it really is right now is definitely the coolest thing I've
3,are you in school what do you study I'm a fourth year chemistry student at USF it's a pretty science II yes pretty science II excellent because today for this level we're talking about sleep great how much sleep do you get typically during the summer like German our turnout during the school year maybe five Wow yeah so how much do you think you need I mean I've read that six is ideal for people in my age range turns out so for people that are between the ages of 18 and 65 the agreed upon amount of sleep that people should get is between seven and nine hours and it's really at least seven hours per night to maintain optimal health as an adult so at least seven hours when we look at across all of the the data that is available on like sleep and health and sleep in psychiatric illness and those types of things the largest risk is when people get five hours or less what do you think kind of is responsible for driving kind of how much sleep you need and things like that I mean I know sleep is kind of regulated by the thalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus sending signals to the pineal gland which kind of secretes melatonin which tells us like when it's time to go to sleep and right you can do part of this level I will do the other part clearly got some expertise under your belt and so that's awesome because I think that everyone should know more about sleep and so the way that we think about what drives sleep are two kind of independent but kind of related processes and so they have kind of lame names process s and process C ok what you've kind of described is process C and that's the master clock right and it helps Rea kind of the rhythms like all of your body all your cells and all those kind of things it drives the release of melatonin from the pineal gland and melatonin comes online under darkness so when the Sun Goes Down your brain knows okay it's it's time to start getting ready for sleep and so you start releasing melatonin which really kind of sets the table for sleeping like I'm from Hawaii so we have very long days we have early sun rises late Sun sets does that signify like less sleep because we have a shorter amount of time for militant ends to be released yeah no that's a really great question and the same thing is true you know in places where the Sun never goes down during the summer and when it's dark all time during the winter it turns out that light isn't the only thing that kind of gates your circadian rhythm but I think the thing that's really important is again there are two processes but the other one is the s process and that one's just kind of a really important driver of sleep and its formal name we call it like the homeostatic sleep drive kind of the longer you're awake the sleepier you get you stay up you get sleepy time goes by you get sleepy air time goes by you get sleep here but it's actually kind of a really fundamental principle for how sleep is regulated and it's really kind of a kin to like a balloon okay so you know you wake up in the morning and your balloon is flat like you kind of like drained out all the sleepiness but then as you kind of go throughout the day it kind of fills up right so you can use your energy it gets filled up and it gets filled up more like as you get towards nighttime right and then when it's at like this optimal amount is when you kind of like go to sleep again this is really what underlies kind of wide napping can also be bad for you so napkins aren't inherently bad but if you know you actually let out some of this air during the day it's gonna take longer for the balloon to get bigger right and where you feel sleepy right okay what did you learn about sleep today I learned about the two processes process and process see I learned about their circadian rhythm and how it doesn't only rely on like melatonin but it also relies on your eating and like a whole bunch of other factors that kind of affect your circadian rhythm hi I'm Eric maze thank
4,you for joining us what do you do or yet so I'm at UC Berkeley I'm a psychology student studying cognitive neuroscience and I just started my third year congratulations thank you so so a lot of brain stuff a lot of brain stuff great I'm biased because I study one of the others of critical parts of the brain the cerebellum so that's good because that's that's why you're here and so we're talking about sleep today and really about kind of what is the brain machinery through which we go from kind of consciousness to unconsciousness and that transition great okay the best way to think about this transition is really called up it's a flip-flop switch okay and so this term comes from engineering and the idea is that in sleep you basically have kind of this all-or-nothing kind of experience you know certainly people kind of drift off to sleep but then also in your unconscious right so it seems like it's this flip-flop between kind of the arousal system and then the sleep promoting system and it's it's certainly regulated and well and we'll get a little bit into that but there's certainly kind of made up of two reciprocally inhibitory processes okay so we have the ascending reticular activating system it originates in the brainstem and there's a dorsal and ventral arm to this and so the the dorsal arm has neurons cholinergic neurons that go up to the thalamus and then it you know projections into the forebrain and then there's the the ventral arm and this is comprised of a whole bunch of different types of neurons that are all monomineralic so there's kind of dopaminergic neurons that come from the periaqueductal gray serotonergic ones from the dorsal raphe nuclei histamine nergic neurons that come from the tuber mammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus and then nor adrenergic neurons from the locus realice and so all of those are kind of working in tandem to kind of drive wake within the brain and you know so if we just think about kind of drugs that are available for inducing wakefulness we can you know it's certainly kind of the dopaminergic ones kind of jump out right so we have kind of in feta means that certainly kind of dry those signaling and then modafinil which is a wake promoting drug for people that have kind of excessive daytime sleepiness that it maintains alertness throughout the day in terms of the dopamine is you know if you're taking amphetamines that's usually to promote as you said wakefulness but does that actually improve the quality of your sleep how reliable are those kinds of interventions the role that they play with respect to the sleep/wake system is really kind of amping up the weak system right and so certainly that has like downstream consequences for the sleep system because now the flip-flops which is kind of pushed you know in a much stronger direction and we have to kind of rely on what regulates sleep to kind of get it pushed back to sleep and do we know much about why or which like which stages are the sleep Skycycle are affected you know if you take amphetamines as a sign when you go to sleep you're not able to transition through each of the different sleep periods or no I think that's what's clear in some ways you know getting back to this idea of this wake sleep system you know we have this sleep system that is kind of the counterpoint to to this wake arousal system and so that the primary nucleus region is the ventral lateral preoptic nucleus they also called VLP oh and that has particular neuron outputs that release GABA and Gamelin which work in an inhibitory way on kind of the the weight promoting ones and so it's this kind of delicate balance of these two systems that are ongoing and your cognitive neuroscience training right it sounds like it's you know pretty specific and focus in a particular part of the brain the cerebellum and I one thing that I'm kind of interested in it's a you bring a participant into the study have you ensured that they got a good night's sleep have you asked them about that in most studies probably it is advised for eight participants before they come in to get a good night's sleep so those would be recommendations that you would lay out you know in communication with the participant before they come in you know what we do in our studies is we actually track people for say a week and they have to kind of get in within this range of amount of sleep and then it has to be both amount of sleep and then how kind of stable it is that variability can really impact it and certainly might have an packed on the machinery that's happening in the brain often think that people many people think that they can get by and very little sleep or less than average meant of sleep but from what I know from the research you know if you actually test those people on different batteries of cognitive tasks you'll often find that they their performance is is slightly worse than maybe they had anticipated yeah so what what did you learn about sleep today I guess I learned that it's a system that is you know very heavily regulated and influenced by you know some of these older more conserved subcortical systems in the brain and that there's as you called it like a flip flop flop function between wakefulness and and sleep that's regulated by these specific like dopaminergic neurons energy like neurotransmitters that manifest in different sub critical parts of the brain so now we have sleep on your brain that was they all I wanted to hear good
5,"to see you again you a yes really glad that you could join us so we've been talking about sleep today at various levels of complexity but now with you I really want to talk about kind of what do we know about sleep and the aging brain can you tell me a lot about some of the work that you've been doing in that area so I'm a pathologist so we do a lot of work on the epidemiology of sleep and development of neurodegenerative diseases including both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease so a dmpd we make me work on population studies we work on thousands and even millions of population and we use statistical modeling to find out the association between different sleep disturbances and also genetics related to sleep disturbances and linked that to their risk of developing AD and Pt so how strong is the link our study has found really strong associations looking at these populations for example with sleep apnea we've done one meta-analysis and it showed that those with sleep apnea they have us ratio of one point two six which means that those have sleep apnea they have 26% elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those without sleep apnea well it's essentially cuz I so so I also saw that there was a recent meta-analysis around sleep disturbances and dementia risk and in that study they looked at about 250,000 people in this meta-analysis and they followed them for around 10 years you know when they pulled all the samples together and they found there was a 1.2 fold risk increased risk for developing all cause dementia and so it sounds like both sleep apnea and then maybe sleep disturbances more generally are associated with increased risk for dementia when I think about that I think about how sleepily lives in the brain these nerds jenner disease live in the brain and so what do we know about the causality of this could it be that individuals who have early onset of say Alzheimer's have then kind of poor sleep as a consequence of that yeah so I think what's really fascinating is all these bi-directional relationship that's being identified in animal studies especially sharing their sleep changes actually occur very early on in the disease process so it could be a proto normal stage of Parkinson's and also in transgenic mouse model of AD they are already showing a lot of circadian abnormalities in this mouse so within dementia risk in particular Alzheimer's for instance there are kind of two clear features that seem to be part of the pathology right so there's kind of beta amyloid which accumulates in the brain and there's kind of these tangles this tau off at these right and so it sounds like you know sleep seems to be related to the tau off at these what about kind of beta amyloid yes in the transgenic mouse models of AD including those expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein AP P tau of both so that's kind of showing the sleep changes in those of these pathologies okay so there is this bi-directional piece but I think you know perhaps the most exciting thing that happened in this sleep field at least in my view has been understanding the role of sleep and it's clearance of beta amyloid brain this idea that sleep is like the dishwasher of the brain it seems like that you know a bat beta accumulates as we kind of use energy and you know it's it's kind of you know it's a waste product and the idea that if you don't clear it out then it's going to build up and accumulate so the thing I'm most excited about sleep research is I think first of all this complexity of the daytime nighttime sleep what sleep is really doing to our body and to our brain and then is really from the epidemiologic or public health perspective how we can best use sleep as a tool for the detection and Prevention of neuro degeneration in the long-term I'm excited about the kind of the future of sleep medicine I think there are incredible innovations that are happening in the basic sciences kind of really starting to understand what are the clear biological processes that underlie some of these things as they relate to disease risk and what is the true function of sleep kind of the why we sleep phenomenon right so this was certainly a challenge today everyone knew a little bit about sleep and I think that's great because sleep is incredibly important but there was also a lot of misinformation around kind of how sleep works and people doing sleep behaviors that may not be the most adaptive for them we're still uncovering new things every day about how sleep works but despite that all of us know that sleep is fundamental to our health and so I'm excited for sleep to kind of raise its profile among other health behaviors and get the investment and care that it needs "
1,do you know why we're here today because we're talking about science yes we're going to talk about science and we're going to talk about a very specific kind of science about people who study brains do you know what a brain is what is it things um so what we're going to talk about this is something that people study in the brain called the connect tone do you know that your body is made up of really tiny things called cells um yes okay well there's more cells in your brain like way more cells than than all the stars we can see and so what the connectome is is we'd like to know where every cell in your brain is and how it talks to every other cell in your brain that was awesome daniel thank you
2,connect tone connect tone to be honest i have no idea that's good that's a great place to start there are cells in your brain those brain cells are connected by wires to each other electricity travels down those wires and communicates from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain and each of those brain cells makes you know a thousand connections something like a hundred trillion connections in one brain in your brain if could i take all of that information and put it inside a computer would that computer then be you computers they don't have feelings they won't have feelings and i think that's one thing that makes the human race wrong i would say that that map also has your feelings in it because here's why your feelings most neuroscientists think come from your brain anyway and amazingly whether when you feel happy or sad or angry or scared that's just brain cells communicating with each other
3,so i think today we're going to talk about a connectome do you have you ever heard of that a connect home yeah no awesome i don't think so it's a map of all the connections between every neuron in your brain uh literally in a human brain something like the map of the one quadrillion connections that 100 billion neurons make with each other is this like a a map where that's like an actual visual representation like using microscopy or just data wow wow i'm understanding more so that it's these these the a mapping of the neuro the circuitry the pathways between neurons that can lead to evidence of patterns in your brain that are common between different people we have to use electron microscopes and then what we have been developing are ways to slice the brain into really thin slices use an electron microscope to take a picture of each slice and then use computers to put it all back imagine that we could get the map of every connection right and we knew how neurons fired do you think we could put that in a computer that map and then therefore that computer should be able to think just like the brain that we extracted it from well the computer only communicates with itself in binary so it only has two options it can only ask itself yes or no questions but a human brain has an infinity of directions that it can go neurons are also digital uh meaning a neuron either fires or it doesn't fire so that's either one or a zero and it's the combination of those ones or zeros that actually produce the 10 000 different answers that you say 
4,it's a large scale attempt to understand the wiring map of the brain actually great i think that it's definitely needed understanding the anatomy of the brain is definitely important but it doesn't necessarily tell us everything about the function so there's some sort of temporal order from neuron to neuron and region to region that we may not be able to pick up this is where it gets really crazy could we simulate that map inside a computer and would that computer then be thinking like that original brain for which we made the map i mean that's not that's not the person i mean having a representation of someone's neural network is just that it's just a representation of their neural network i mean because there's more to the to you in here than just information passing between neurons i'd like to think so it would be like if you simulated a hurricane imagine we could keep track of every variable of a hurricane wind speed every water molecule etc etc temperature and we put that inside a super fast computer and we simulated it right i don't think anyone would think that the inside of the computer would get wet even though we had simulated the hurricane perfectly that wetness is consciousness is what we are is it ethical to imagine mapping a male brain versus a female brain to look for differences between those to explain alleged behavioral differences between them every single person is different and so it should be okay to map every single person's brain i mean i understand that there are that it's very sensitive you know what do you think is sensitive mapping an indian brain versus a caucasian brain or politically i think that people may have some issue with mapping out what causes or what makes a difference between different types of people
5,maybe a wiring diagram is not sufficient to understand the brain and it would be crazy to think that that would be sufficient actually if you limit the connectom to be just the wiring diagram without you know more information about uh myelination or glial cells correct all types of environmental features that surround you know the neurons and axons then then you have an incomplete picture right no doubt sometimes when people get um they worry about connectomics i think what they're actually worrying about is that it's the end of the way that we used to do neuroscience what do you think about memory do you think that there's um ways of resolving what the substrate of human memory is you know is it just ltp and lcd i'm not sure if you had a connectome of a human brain of an adult human i would be able to read out memories from that you don't think it's just the synaptic weights like an artificial neural network it's trained to do particularly it could absolutely be but without knowing what the weights were before the memory was made what if you had a violinist learn a piece of bach music yes could you find those notes somewhere in their brain yes they didn't know before yes um you know i'm a musician and i don't think it's possible i think that there are too many you know so much of it is associative to what you already know uh-huh and as a musician how much of it do you think is in your hands versus in your brains uh meaning like you do have connections in your muscles from the nerves that are from your spinal cord uh what if some of the learning is there are you still doing em or yeah i mean we do a lot of x-ray in addition to em and this is actually i'm not saying it's the only problem but it's the only problem that needs to be solved right away is that the data analysis right in fact i think we calculated that there aren't enough humans ever to map a mouse brain uh uh where will you collect every connection and uh etc so the problem is to get algorithms to to trace to recognize things in brains the way humans uh uh recognize things in brains or map things trace things in brains it's going to cost a lot of money uh to imagine setting the gold standard for the wiring diagram even once and that's what i'm those are the kinds of ethical concerns that i'm worried about one of the things that we're not doing well as a field is sort of educating and telling people beyond our field the benefits of what we can achieve and i'm impressed that when you talk to people about something that seems kind of crazy and outlandish and perhaps they hadn't been talking about before it doesn't take them long to come to a kind of considered opinion especially children i think it's kind of amazing i mean i do hope that more people talk about brains and what we use brains for and the ways that we shouldn't use our brains so i think this field has the opportunity to make that more real
1,the University of Waterloo I study lasers and in particular I like really high intensity lasers so a laser is a way to get light to actually just be a single color going in a single direction all of the waves peaking at the same time so that the intensity can get very high today I've been challenged to explain lasers and high intensity lasers at five different levels from a child to a teenager to a college student to a graduate student and finally to a colleague of mine so I was told that maybe science is one of your favorite subjects at school is that right yes yeah have you actually studied light yet yes okay what have you learned so far about light so we learn how to like actually light up oh really Oh excellent well I'm somebody you'd like studies lasers so what do you think about lasers you know you haven't gotten to play with lasers so I brought one that's you know my friend's cat toy do you ever use a laser as a cat toy and one of the fun things people do with lasers the cat will try to grab that dot I'm sure what you have at home is a flashlight I brought a cute little one so the question is do you see any difference between what a flashlight does and what a laser does that's true the lace is just a dot and so the other thing to notice though is that this seems like when I shine it in your eyes I am sorry if I do but it seems awfully bright doesn't it and yet when you know you shine this down and you put the laser which one do you see easier laser so which one do you think's more powerful and yet it's not isn't that amazing yeah one of the things that lasers are great for is that it because of its a directed beam we can actually put that light where we want the light to go and sometimes we maybe just want to see something around a corner and you can't see it but with a laser you can actually and this is a smoky one so you can actually watch it go you see it actually bending the corner oh and that's because the light will go through this glass but when it hits that corner it has to bend and we actually sound laser beams down glass fibers the size of your hair yeah so this obviously is much bigger than our hair right so this is just a demonstration if you have a laser like this it actually bends and comes out I'm going to point it to you and you'll see it coming out the other end it hits these walls it has to go around and come out the other side you won't play so that's the first time you've seen a laser have you gotten to play with laser somewhere else I don't so you don't need a cat so I know have you ever gone to a grocery store and just scanned your objects over have you ever seen that maybe this is a little bit of a red light when you do that that's a laser we cut steel with them now we actually do surgery with lasers you know when some people have either scars or birthmarks that they don't want to see we can actually remove those with lasers now we've never seen a laser light show when they light up the sky with lasers it's almost like fireworks oh you got to say a shooting star well that's that's cool that's nature giving you the show there so what do you think about lasers I think they're fun and the next time you go to a grocery store take a peek at the red okay
2,today we're here to talk about lasers so what do you think about lasers um I think they're pretty cool they show put in a lot of my favorite books and movies like Star Wars so just a bunch of different sci-fi movies and books do you know anything about lasers what makes the laser special kind of light all I really know is from like sci-fi books and movies and like the factory cutting lasers that they used to like cut steel and stuff did it even know maybe how to make a laser that it would be strong enough to cut steel no okay so one of the things about lasers is if you've ever seen a laser beam you know it's very directed like what are they made out of what does a laser made out of well really it's sort of the same thing as a light bulb right because people to beam so yeah it's a light bulb and there's a couple of mirrors now the light bulb has to be a little bit special it has to be a type of material that can store the energy in an excited state right it has to stay up there really energetic and sit there for a while so that when the light comes along it takes that energy and become stronger light and then the mirror sends it back and it does it again and again and again and between these two mirrors it makes the light come out in a nice beam in a laser it comes out as a single color they all come out with their waves at the same time every wave peaks at the same time which then makes it a giant wave and it's this giant wave that has a tremendous amount of power so it can do something like cutting steel but when you cut steel or if you're cutting this floor it's great it actually will absorb the light that's why the light you don't see it because the light isn't bouncing back or through it so I like to use demos to explain how my laser works so I've brought basically a hammer and a nail I'm sure you've probably hammered a nail before into a piece of wood but the question is if you asked yourself why it is that we hit the big end and it's the tiny end that we put on the piece of wood we would never pick up a hammer and hit the sharp hit the sharp end and hope this would go into the piece of wood because in to be center so can more easily just go in that's right it's all the same force that we apply up here goes all the way through but then it can only basically come out when it contacts the wood in that one tiny spot and so sometimes it's the force that you push something with but sometimes it is that force per unit area but sometimes it's not even the force per unit area because you know push down as hard as you can on that that and see if we can get it pushed in it doesn't really work does it so the laser needs ultimately thinks it needs well if titty centered it needs time to like actually penetrate and then it needs well it depends so if you're cutting steel you need to have the nail you need to have it concentrated all of the light not going in all directions but you need it into a smaller point as possible and for that we use a lens for a lens the lights coming down as a column you put in a lens it all focuses it down in the same way as the nail and then it starts cutting that steel okay so that's sort of force per unit area so it's kind of like a magnifying glass like get my good twice at lay it down to a point exactly you know sometimes you want to have all of your energy not just in a small area but in this small volume and so one of the other dimension is time or light but with light time and lengths are the same thing because light always travels at the speed of light exactly but if you send one second long light pulse out into the skies there the beginning of the pulse is actually two thirds of the way to the moon it's three hundred thousand kilometers long so now if you talk about light being concentrated that doesn't seem very concentrated the type of lasers I play with in my lab will be no thicker than this piece of paper so we take that energy that might be in three hundred thousand kilometers and we squeeze it all the way down into just this piece of paper and actually the beams are more the size of this piece of paper okay and so in my lab they would be flying pieces of paper like this would be flying through the sky but we can't see them because they don't come in our eyes they fly by us and they're infrared we like little concentrated beams of light exactly where and so now if we have light like that that we want a machine with I bring this funnel and so if we had a lens here the light was coming down so funnel sent into a spot so here would be my light coming from my laser no just be coming down down down down down hit a lens and we have to focus down but now all the light started out with this big of a spread so concentrated this much eventually it would be here more concentrated but by the end right at the focal spot that's when I get all of my light all of the energy has been squeezed down into fitting inside this piece of paper and that's why I say that I built a laser hammer because when this hits a piece of glass it just smacks those electrons right off the atoms and there's nothing else for them to do they have to fly away so can you tell me what you learned and maybe about the focusing of the light well what I learned is lasers they aren't like particles they're more like a super concentrated beam light that can be any color they get really concentrated and that's what makes them like play serious and that's why they cut things and break things because it just moves the electrons out of the way so do you think that lasers are fun enough to talk with your friends about her of course I'm gonna have to share something about my experience learning about lasers was an expert like you so you're a college student yes and
3,physics major with a minor in math I'm in the 3-2 program for biomedical engineering excellent I got an engineering physics degree there you go something in common we're here today talking about lasers so have you had much exposure to lasers yet that's cool not yet I am really hoping that we will I think it's super interesting just the field in general because I really do enjoy examining all the calculations and being able to do a little bit more of the math side effect okay as opposed to the experimental side of it and seeing things okay so I'm much more I like to see the things happening so then the question is what's so special about making a light that's intense enough to actually possibly blow things out certainly we can blow atoms up with the laser hammer and the laser light comes in and just smacks the electron right off the atom and so the question really is is how do you make that back in the 70s and into the 80s I know that's a long time ago for you we had big energy lasers and we had short pulse lasers we couldn't have big energy short pulse lasers and actually it was my supervisor and I that figured the way around that and we got something called chirped pulse amplification have you heard of chirped pulse a awful fication by any chance vaguely well I brought a little bit of a prop to explain how chirps pulse amplification works our short pulses are made of different colors I've got a colored slinky here we probably could have called it stretched pulse amplification but that's kind of boring so we used the word chirped the word chirped comes around because birds chirp when the birds are singing the notes are actually changing audio frequency with time and that's a chirp the point is that when all the light is squeezed together like this it's a short pulse and that's when it's a hammer because all the light is now concentrated and you can imagine if this was coming along and also using a lens to focus it small than all of that light at the focal spot concentrate and so that was the laser hammer so we can't have that in the laser so the question is what could we do the fact that it's different colors and different colors because of dispersion travel different speeds inside material so we used a long fiber one point four kilometers of fiber but in fiber the red colors really haven't got that much in common with the glass atoms and so they spend very little time you know interacting and they travel fast the red is going to start traveling faster than the green faster than the blue and as you travel down the fiber next thing you know you have a long pulse and it's chirped from red at the beginning to blue at the back and so the frequencies go whoo okay so this is a chirped pulse and now it's a long pulse and so first this is what we did we chirped it we stretched him then we can safely amplify it because it's not all concentrated and after we amplify it then we use something called a compressor and we put all of the colors back together and it was back being short pulse but a high-energy pulse and to get that we really had what I like to call it laser hammer when this laser pulse goes inside it smacks those electrons right off the atom so the laser hammer that you were describing with other types of lasers and the one in the tripped is it's still the same premise well a lot of lasers and when lasers first came along there were only single color your cat to are below to be a singer color probably a red one and so that's just one color and one color means that it has to really be there for the whole time one color is one wavelength of light and so it's just one wave that goes on and on and on if you want a short pulse you actually have to have all the colors and if you can imagine at one point in time and I like to say it's like a conductor of an orchestra when you're listening to an orchestra warm up they sound terrible they're all playing their own notes but when the conductor conducts them they all play different notes but together it's beautiful music so we have something in a laser called a mo blocker and it's like the conductor and it says to go now and all the colors will start together but some colors are long wavelength and others are shorter so next thing you know you have peaks meeting valleys and they cancel each other and so the more colors you can bring in the faster that happens and the shorter the policy committees the necklace is something that was designed for my Nobel Prize it's sold at Nobel Museum and it is a chirped pulse so we've been talking a lot about lasers and applications what have you learnt about your pulses I learned that it all stretches which is super cool because red moves the fastest and so it kind of tugs around blue it really threw me off just how fast it's hard to imagine things happening that fast and I also learned how many of the things that I know are lasers and how many of the things that I've been looking for like the answers to it is in lasers so I
4,understand you in grad school where I don't know why you and what he's studying I'm studying soft matter physics which in was the physics of squishies stuff we make micro swimmers in the laboratory and we drive them with a laser and what kind of laser to use we use a 10 watt laser it's a fiber laser do you know a lot about lasers or just about the laser that you use not about you just a little bit okay so this is about high intensity lasers no no how do you make them but what was really stopping them being made in both cases nonlinear optics you know we want to do something that requires a huge photon density application yes and so that's how come we came up with chirp false amplification so that we could stretch the pulse safely amplify it then compress it at the end and then we're ready to do whatever we want at the end so what do you think the main difference is between the continuous-wave laser that you have that runs at 10 watts and a chirped pulse amplifier I feel like the continuous laser delivers power to continuous rate whereas you want all that power to be delivered in a really really short time but with your amplification and so we get the power with a lot less energy because it's power is energy per unit time sorry we aren't depositing much energy in comparison yes can I just ask cos sure you are using the thermal process of it heating up but is have you ever had the opportunity to use a laser tweezers I have yeah we use optical tweezers to trap particles institution okay and and twirl the motors are not told the motors I know I haven't what you're over that okay so I was always curious how much further like what higher power can we go now so trip falsification took a sort of fun we were at ten to the twelve but when I was working the ten to the twelfth sort of sat on a football size field it was a kilojoule laser with a nanosecond pulse okay and we brought it down to something we'd call tabletop terawatt so it was the same terawatt but now it was one jewel in one picosecond so it could fit on a basic optical bench like you would have in your lab we were able to take that up to I think the record is right around somewhere between 10 to the 22 and 10 to the 23 watts per square centimeter so then and going forward one of the Holy Grails is can we reach ten to the twenty-nine watts per square centimeter so we saw six orders so we've gone from ten to the twelve to ten to the 23 so we've done you know eleven order so you think six isn't so much harder I have to tell you over time it's rolling over its we need another Nobel prize-winning idea but if we get out there that's where if you focus the intensity the energy in that volume is enough to break the vacuum we could probably use this to drive chemical reactions at a very very specific spot like if we wanted I get just a single cell in the body yes and and and maybe what do pump probe spectroscopy and watch the cell or to ionize it I mean I was thinking more on the lines of if we want to let's say destroy one cell like I do myself or something like that so that neighboring areas are not affected but just the cell thanks I don't know if people working on that because I'm not so much of the reticle field but I should look into that and see if that's a possibility so after hearing about high intensity lasers can you think about next time you go back to the lab and you're wondering how to do something in the love with lasers can you see how short pulses might help you I think short pulses might have been my experiment in the sense that if I Drive my swimmers with a continuous wave as opposed to a pulsed wave maybe a continuous wave would heat up the sample too much and a pulsed laser would deliver power exactly where I need it so that I could run my experiment from there maybe that's true thank you very much thank you nice to meet you hello Donna good to
5,see you here with me so we go way back 1991 year I got married I moved across the country left my husband in New Jersey Sark with you at Livermore I remember very much and how hard it was to convince you to travel across the country and work at the lab and stay there and stay there I couldn't convince you to stay you could not get through this day though especially there long enough to make a big impression and get some good work done and I've been talking sort of starting with sort of what is a laser through linear optics nonlinear optics high intensity laser physics and saying that you know we're trying to get to that showing her limit of ten to the twenty-nine watts per square centimeter we're at about somewhere just shy of 10 to the 23 I think at this point but even if we get to 100 petawatts and focus that down to a wavelength we're not at ten to the twenty-nine yes so you're hoping to build the biggest laser yes at Rochester but we're still not going to get to the stronger limit isn't that right so just a little bit of back history again after you you know demonstrated CPA I was intrigued by how powerful could we make lasers and then how lasers are wonderful because you know they allow you to take energy and compress it in space and time so having high peak power and something it's been a motivator for me for a long time and so we at the University are making proposals to build 225 petawatt lasers maybe 30 petawatt lasers we'll use them to be able to get combined power of the over 10 to the 24 watts per square Center still far from the swinger limit but we have a trick we're going to use one of these petawatt lasers to make an electron beam and this electron beam will be relativistic we actually think we could make electron beam maybe even hundreds of GEB up to a TV which would be another nobel prize that's right you can do that go for it and then we will shine that laser onto that electron beam and the electrons bris frame we meet the swinger limit okay that's kind of cheating that's not getting to ten to the twenty nine if you do it with 100% efficiency that's all we need that's why I wanted that Nobel Prize because again if we're able to do this you know it's way as I can see today right I can see us doing it today by just exploiting it what we already know and take it to a limit then that would be a real motivator I think to be able to even take these texts needs further cheating is not the right exact word is taking advantage of relativity take advantage of all physics not just optical physics since that's why we want to do it this way we have to get into entertainment when is the high intensity laser gonna get into entertainment so then there's real money yes yes well we have started the photon torpedoes that's why what they actually knew what you were doing is if you ever seen a start though Star Trek had like science fiction no Star Trek had photon torpedoes and they show bursts of light about this long it was the same thing because if he's down a second pulse it how much energy it carried and you can see it but I'm what it was scattering off of but you could see it so it was a great thing so we can either cheat by doing laser accelerating and going into that rest frame yes and that's like you said we're stuck a little bit we're not up to that kind of acceleration so that would be a Nobel prize-winning possibly or we need going around and giving my talks now I show how her plateauing I showed how there was a plateau see PA raises it up but we're sort of started a plateau again and we need another Nobel Prize winning idea and so do you think it's on the horizon do you see anything out there that really says oh yeah that's that's a good way to go because we're going to have to get out to the x-rays right we can't we can't stay in the visual so actually I think you do there's a potential ways of doing it with optical or near optical radiation and you know there's been a lot of work done in the Defense Department officers of how do I combine laser beams together okay and make them act as a one coherent source so one of the things that we'll be doing with our two petawatts we're going to see if we can actually combine them into a 15 if you can do that you can begin to imagine doing this with many lasers many petawatt lasers of the scale we're talking about so one could possibly see an X want from that you know which I you know people have been able to combine tens of lasers together for a coherent source so you have to be able to phase lock them you have to be able to make them you know there fazes be exactly connected and related and be able as they propagate through all the different optical components whatever may be just and don't you think that's the process the entire Appetit it's because it's not like our beams are as perfect as we all like to think they are so it's right so you have to have so over the Aperture Science you have to have them phase-locked across the entire aperture which will be a great challenge and people done again with small lasers the laser will be trying to is about 40 centimeter aperture so we'll begin to start looking at this and actually wave fun control I mean be able to adaptive optics other ways which you can control the uniformity of the phase is something that's been developed in lots of ways now here for defense applications for science applications so we'll do our best to make use of all these technologies lasers I think have progressed so much just like the semiconductor business because there's such a market or there's so many different applications okay so there's a lot of us working around the world on these high intensity lasers and so what do you think the real fun is what do you see the real excitement being I remember when the laser was first demonstrated in 1960 what could we do with this we already got light now we can't live without lasers my cell phone that is in my pocket has billions of transistors how is that made with lasers you know all integrated circuitry is done with lasers actually now it's being using x-rays made from Blaser he didn't matter that came out of the laser fusion program so it is amazing the parallels and optics is used everywhere we're going to possibly take over from CERN and let's we'll just do high-energy physics no lasers we're looking at gravity waves with lasers we want to do black holes with lasers we want a machine with lasers we want to do medicine with lasers everywhere and now with the Nobel Prize people are hearing more about it so they know lasers are everywhere I couldn't agree with you more and you winning Nobel Prize has been an inspiration to lots of people only three women have won the Nobel Prize in Physics and only one educated in the United States and I use that every place ok and only one Canadian there you [Laughter] today was fun I got to explain the work I do at all levels it's always fun for me to talk to elementary school students because they bring such enthusiasm with a student who's already started to learn optics to a graduate student and finally my own colleague where we can really get into a huge conversation about what's the future of this field electronics was the technology for the 20th century and it brought us the transistor electrons don't move nearly as fast as light and so trust me photonics will take us where we want to go in this century 
1,you like science yes a lot oh very good you come to the right place so we're gonna think about physics have you heard the word physics before do you know what that is what's your idea what physics is I'm not so sure okay I just think of physics as you know the study of everything what stuff is what stuff does so today we're going to talk about space and in particular the idea of dimensions have have you heard about dimensions I think I mean I ain't enough 3d printing 3d printing good no I own keys the size all I have to do with the shape but you know what 3d means it's free dimensional three dimensional as opposed to what is ordinary printing so ordinary printing would be 2 d what do you say when something is one-dimensional what's an example of something it's one-dimensional a line is the perfect example because it's one thing that's straight right so here's some toys we're gonna build some dimensions right so what would you say about this that's 1 exactly it's not really one dimensional everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's free dimensional and how would you find yourself like if someone said where are you like could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line I think I would be a maybe there since I'm facing it but here's what I wanted to think about if I say I'm at this point on the line I could translate that into saying I'm at the three-centimeter point if I were here I via the four-centimeter point the five-centimeter point right so every point every location on our little line has its own unit as its own unit has one number we need one number to tell you where we are that's one dimension that's what it means to be one dimensional I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are because if it's like a sphere you kind of have to start using points there you go exactly we're gonna build a little two dimensional space you wanna do it you wanna do the honors here why don't you put those two lines together if you make it mental is this a corner exactly another way is if you are two spacing between is an angle I think you should be in this chair and he should be explaining this to me you're much better than this than I am yeah so those are the dimensions that's how we think about dimensions remember we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane I think that would be an X or Y axis there you go so do you think we could have more than three dimensions 3d is the maximum of dimensions for shapes well as far as we know this is why physicists think about things we don't know about we're wondering whether it could be extra dimensions you've never seen that are tinier than atoms so okay so what have you learned what do you know about dimensions now how do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before so at least everything has a certain dimension yeah do you think he'd be excited a physicist said that they found extra dimensions of space that would be the news would be spreaded around the world rocket I think so I think you're right all right Hank we want you to you know keep up studying learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions someday does that sound like a fun idea yeah
2,do you like science doesn't think about what kind of science I like biology and computer science all right you're in the wrong place we're not gonna be talking about biology computer science so we want to talk about the idea of dimensions the other dimension is how you define dimensions I guess I don't know how to exactly define it but I know like the first floor right you know the difference between like one dimension dimensions three dimensions etc so let's do a little experiment here so there's one dimension I'll give that to you now here's here's your task I'm gonna give you another dimension and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other it's easy to do so there's no trace here I'm not trying to pull you here okay now this will be slightly trickier I'm going to give you this I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time there you go so what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two-dimensional plane right like the two things pick out a plane the three things pick out all three dimensional space now we'll give you one more I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time all right now I am can't be done you can't do it so we just experimentally proved that space is three-dimensional that's sort of what it means to be three-dimensional that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in okay there you go three dimensional space right mm-hmm so have you thought about using coordinates in three dimensions yeah I was actually doing SAT prep there you go it showed like the x y&z axis as well that's right so that's exactly what these would be have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYZ no but we could also say how far we are away from the center just the distance and then the angle that our little line makes with that's a B X ax yeah so that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself and we called polar coordinates is a different coordinate system well we want to do as physicist is look for extra dimensions can you imagine can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions time time yes Einstein that said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself but what about space what about the solar system like if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky do you know what how we do that I have no idea it's it's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky so astronomers call them right Ascension and declination which are two terrible words but basically you've seen you know on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude what it looks like yeah there are the peals of an orange kind of thing right yeah so you can define something as well you know how high above a certain location on earth it is but the earth is rotating and revolving around the Sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates so there's like mold how many dimensions would there be we don't know you know the optimistic view is that there are six but the thing is some of them might be really really really really really small like way too small for us to ever see yeah and some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see okay so since it's all theoretical like this could not be three dimension and this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living out you know honestly out there if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist and have them say no that's just nonsense okay after all this yeah someone comes up to you on the street and says what's a dimension oh man I mean I guess what I've learned today is just that there are not just three dimensions or at least we think I mean everything's theoretical it's all just really kind of confusing that's right and you know if they're still bugging you you can just like give them some sticks and act as we're together and that would shut them up yeah
3,you study I'm gonna be a sophomore from ona college and I study math and physics Oh math and physics okay what kind of physicists do you want to be you know I really don't know I like theory and experimental so it's kind of tough for me to say usually if it's math and physics you end up as a theoretical physicist right yeah experimental one so our theme here today is dimensions and so this is great that you have some math background some mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way yeah so how would you explain to you know your friends who are not math and physics majors like what is it dimension yourself my first intuitive thought is water like the coordinates you know so if we were looking at things we're looking like a dot that's like one or a line rather that's one dimensional because we can only measure it one way but now if we look at like a square then we're increasing like that so it's like all basically the what coordinates we can use to measure something that's exactly right and so you've heard of space time yeah being four-dimensional right now in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me because of course you have space which is three-dimensional you have time which is one dimensional so space-time is four-dimensional but it didn't turn out it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity this is the crucial thing right is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space but how we divide space time into time and space can be different for different people and really there's a real sense in which four-dimensional space-time is kind of a generalization of three-dimensional space and I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard okay let's bring what it all right think about relativity is that they really want you to think of space-time as one four-dimensional thing right it's kind of like space it's not just three dimensions of space in one dimension of time why though why this is a very good question so let's just start with space right you know a little bit about space so here's my simple-minded way of drawing space two dimensions because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard let's say x and y and what is special about space there's many things but one is that if I have you know a curve or a path between two points there's a distance that you can calculate right and the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates it doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates or whatever I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points and if I were a person walking on that curve I would have an a domitor with me maybe and I would know you you would know even without having done that this path has always going to be longer than that there's a formula I thank you mrs. theorem it tells you what the shortest distance path is that's the point the physicalness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve so space-time is like that that's why it is useful to think about space okay so let me draw space-time is how we usually draw it I'll just say X but all of space is condensed this one direction and this is time okay so if you're a little person you start at some event so you start you're located somewhere in space somewhere the three coordinates of space and whether you like it or not you're moving through space-time just by getting older yeah when people ask me can you travel through time I say yes yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and Here I am you know the day later so that's just this okay you're moving through time like that so what Einstein says is look I can travel through space-time in different ways like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back and then I can meet you there so this is a different trajectory through space-time right yeah and it's almost exactly like the space story the space story says there's a distance distance is different along different Irv's Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves and we call it the proper time it is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch so it's kind of like our like fundamental time I got face time well kind of what Einstein wants to get across this there's no such thing as fundamental like there's the universe is time this big letter T that might you know tell you how old the universe is but then every individual has a clock with them and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universes and the crucial difference is the time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair and this person who zoomed out there why is that this one is shorter than there is what we call a metric on space time and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space versus a sphere or something that's a different metric and space-time has its own metric which says the following thing that the path between two events in space-time that is a straight line will always be the longest time I see okay that's the difference all right so what when I had this idea Oh gravity could be related to the curvature of space-time he did some equations okay so he got it that's a long story will satisfy what he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of space-time it's a manifestation of the curvature of space-time so when you have like the earth the Sun the moon they cause a gravitational field they're actually warping the space-time around them they're giving it a different geometry would it be if I had like a spring off or not a spring like a like a sheet and I dropped like a book in the sheet curves down yeah exactly if you if you had a sheet that was originally flat and you know you sent a marble on it would go in a straight line then if you put something on it so it warps it that marble is now gonna be deflected I see Einstein says the gravity is just like that I see but there are no straight lines because space-time itself is curved so do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say I think I'd go with like the kind of like the Train paradox let's say I'm stationary and someone's moving past me on the train they think they're stationary on the train like they think that they're not accelerating but if they start walking through the train cars then they are accelerating in their frame but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed I see they're accelerating so I guess that relativity is all about perspective I guess in a way yeah that's right and it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board and we're how those two people in the Train and on the ground would divide space-time up differently you have to space in time that's pretty good yeah it's a lot of fun stuff to talk about so observational
4,cosmology so like what would he look at so I work on two ground-based surveys and the optical and we're basically trying to make huge maps of the universe so that we can study dark energy I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit I've heard it yeah I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space what is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen I get a little scared cuz I think oh how can you prove these theories right one theory I've heard of I don't know if this fits in with that is bubble universes it's not an extra dimension does that fit into that or is that something it does in fact one way that different universes might sort of be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions like we have three dimensions around us but there's people out there aliens who could live in five dimensional universes and are each of those dimensions do are they governed by the same laws of physics or is there like a separate lagrangian for each universe yeah how does that work we think that it would be you know all this is incredibly speculative and we don't know for sure but the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same but they show up differently so they appear different so the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse okay why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions right so you've heard of string theory I have so the string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity mm-hmm so we have quantum mechanics right the theory of you know atoms and so forth and how those work and then we have gravity and gravity doesn't seem to fit in it's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical so string theory is one of the best right ideas that's the good news the bad news is that it only seems to work if space-time is ten dimensional so you would say well then it's wrong it can't be right space-time is not 10 dimensional space-time is four dimensional you've observed that but instead we say if space-time looks four dimensional to us but string theory which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be 10 dimensional maybe we could hide those extra six dimensions somehow so here's how we could get lucky we could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them this is actually an old idea it goes back to Colusa and klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915 but there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions there could be extra dimensions that are actually that big like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed but here's the new exciting idea so let's imagine okay there's a piece of paper but let's imagine this is our entire world so in other words our real world is three dimensional but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions so we all live here you and I live here but let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space so there are extra dimensions that are actually big ok let's imagine that when I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of right the quarks the leptons the electrons and everything all the forces we know about electromagnetism the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force imagine that they can't leave this surface this is what will we call a brain BR ane have you heard this word before right yes do you know where it comes from no from membranes you know we have lines one dimension we have two-dimensional surfaces so if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing you call it a string right right if you have a two-dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing we call that a membrane membrane theory goes back it never was as popular as string theory but it's been around for a while but if you have extra dimensions of space then you can have three-dimensional vibrating things and four-dimensional vibrating things so how do these strings give rise to things like mass in charge and basically give us the properties of the particles we see well basically the strings are the particles that we see it's exactly the same thing as we said you know for the straw if you look at it far away it looks one-dimensional a little loop of string so a little one-dimensional circle that is vibrating if you look at it from very very far away it just looks like a particle so in string theory an electron is a little string a photon is a little string so is string theory part of what they call the grand unified theory is it's supposed to be the the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together yeah string theory is even better so the phrase grand unified theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism so a good string theory is gravity plus a grand unified theory that's even better is the theory of everything what would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are what extra dimensions are what a brain is so we have three spatial dimensions a brain is sort of the next level so a brain is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space that's right and we could live there the world we see around us the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brain trying to escape it was really cool to learn about strings and brains and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do and looking at gravity on these cosmological scales and it's definitely something I'm going to think about in my research you're a string theorist so
5,tell us like what kind of string theory you do what it means to be you string theorists one of the things that's key in the whole story of string theory is the piece of it that talks about quantum theories of gravity so I'm very excited about what happens to space-time what does even mean at the quantum level cool so do you think a lot about extra dimensions in your everyday life yes I do and so when you think about extra dimensions you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth right yes you know a lot of people a lot of string theorists they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions as someone who cares about cosmology I want to start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all how did happen is this something you think about yourself yes well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe if string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about we'd like to know with all of these possibilities of the in string theory how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in the thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realized there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously dynamically if you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything but within some region of space you could make a tube okay right and down there in the tube it looks like you're a long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extend in the other direction so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space okay I think that sounds plausible to you it sounds like fun what I would immediately ask is whether the large dimensions come from in the first place is that something you address or you just assume that large debate all the dimensions are large as a starting point yeah so we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point and it's worse than that so in our paper we imagine you start in de sitter space you start in a universe with no matter no anything like that just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large but where do they come from it was always there why why not okay this is replacing one prejudice for the different prejudice I would say that we shouldn't be prejudiced one way or the other just a large you know 10 or 11 dimensions with the cosmological constant doesn't seem like a fundamental starting point it's it sounds like there needs to be something to underlie that but it's a fun scenario yeah so let me tell you a little bit more about the scenario so you know there are black holes good right I've heard of them there are black brains as well why don't you explain to us what a black brain is well in some ways it's very much like a black hole and that you have far away from it you have these large just you know flat dimensions as you move in there's there's something in the it has itself higher dimensions and so because physicists love to joke they thought well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions and so they call them P brain yeah I've been trying to explain them to lower levels and they always look at me like I like your a little bit or is this the real thing that they use yes it is the real thing they use we study these brains in de sitter space and so we what we found is that there are black brain solutions which instead of having a singularity inside our non singular and stable and compactified is this a familiar thing I know things like this have been discussed yeah yeah so a lot of the brains that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de sitter spacetime x' in various dimensions actually start out as these non singular type brains and then you find in the core there's actually an entity sitter spacetime right imagine that rather than going down to a point it just ask some totes to some fixed radius and continues infinitely far down but then you can ask okay what about the rest of the university have like some sphere some two dimensions compactified and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a distance but then the other dimensions the transverse dimensions don't need to be anti-de sitter they can have either positive 0 or negative cosmological constant so you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly all the possible solutions I guess I mean maybe maybe you think otherwise again or maybe we could change my mind I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time right you mean the one of the things that could happen so I mean obviously you know we know one of them baby I stole that from Kenna Reeves I'm afraid someone probably wrote it for you so it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de sitter space with positive cosmos constant some field flying around you inevitably get a multiverse it just happened you know it's just part of quantum nucleation two different things and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that so how does how does our kind of you know Tech old-fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about well it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de sitter space where the cosmological constant has you know right wrong sign so you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read probably you've read more of them that I have which try then to take different kinds of brains these extended solutions or and there many different kinds doing different things we understand them well enough now that we can put them together in various ways they intersect they dissolve inside each other they and you do them all in all sorts of different ways and shows that you can construct four-dimensional universes with a cosmological constant of your desire depending upon how you did the construction not everyone buys that there's a big discussion in the literature right now and if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics and it's just amongst us chickens what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory and the dynamics of these extra dimensions I think it's gonna get way more interesting than then we're currently able to grapple with right now and I think there are hints of it there could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description and then from that emerges flat space times maybe for maybe some mechanism tells you it's for not something else I think that's where we're going if the viewers want to know more about how space-time can emerge from quantum mechanics they could read the graphic novel you just wrote right yes I wrote in drew a graphic novel called the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe and I just wrote a book called something deeply hidden about many worlds quantum mechanics and how space-time can emerge from it plenty reading material for the audience out there excellent so that was fun I hope that everyone did learn something I know that I did it was very nice to see how the idea of dimensions and space resonates in different ways with different people all the way up to talking to Clifford about the forefront of modern research I really do think that we're not done understanding how dimensions work there are three dimensions of space why that why not - why not 27 I think that we really don't yet have the data or ideas to think about this but we're creeping up on it I'm optimistic about progress in the near future I'm a professor at the University of Waterloo and I'm a sleep scientist at UCSF today I've been challenged to explain lasers to explain the topic of sleep at five different levels 
1,hi it's really really nice to meet you what's your name my name is Skyler Skyler we're here to talk about the internet and I bet you must use the internet a lot right yeah what's your conception about what the internet is the internet for me it's just something to use when I need like to search up something or right watch videos the internet is physically these computers that all talk to each other billions of computers in the case of the internet the internet allows us to do a lot of really really interesting what we call applications you ever think about how that video gets to you over the Internet yeah I have no idea got a favorite movie Matilda Matilda all right we're going to actually build an internet I've got couple of things here that I want to show you or a couple of toys actually okay let's pretend that these round balls are computers and the internet is something that connects them and right now the Internet is just one communication link and Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer to your computer so the internet is a network for carrying information from one computer to another now this network here looks pretty simple doesn't it right it's just one thing should we add some more friends in yeah let's say we want to get a video from here over to here how do you think that video would sort of travel through this network uh maybe I could go to here to here to here to here that's right so that's pretty cool there are actually lots of different ways to actually go through the internet to get from what we call a source the place that's sending the information to the receiver the place that's actually Gathering the information together and that's something we actually call routing huh but wouldn't it just be different for it to go from here to here instead of going from here to here to here to here yeah so that that's a really good observation in most pieces of the internet that's exactly what would happen we want to take sort of what's called a shortest path but still there are multiple paths and why do you think that might be valuable maybe one way is like messed up or broken so you don't know why exactly so Skyler that was a great discussion about what we just built and I wanted to talk to you about or ask you about maybe one other really important part about networks and it's not so much the thing itself the physical thing but more about the rules about communication that's governed by something that are called Protocols are you up for one yeah knock knock who's there lettuce lettuce who let us go on a knock knock joke is an example of a protocol right the computer that you're using say makes a request you ask for something you get something in return in the internet there are protocols everywhere so that two computers that have never talked to each other before know the rules for talking to each other this Global Internet with billions of people using it are just lots of smaller networks that are all hooked together to each other but also what the internet allows are all of these what we call applications Zoom video playing Services can all run on top of the same internet yeah so there's one internet fall mom exactly there's one internet and lots and lots and lots of things that you can do on top of it foreign
2,well we're going to be talking about computers here today we're going to be talking about the internet I always like to think of the Internet by analogy to say Road systems for example where you have you know roads in your neighborhood you have state roads you have the interstate highway system and so the internet is a lot like that it's an interconnection of local roads local networks like the network in your house for example how does like all of the um networks in my house connect to all the city networks that's good wow great question often it's a little blue wire called an Ethernet cable so that cable is able to bring bits of information up into your apartment at say a billion bits per second that's pretty fast right literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment that comes from an internet service provider come into this first Network and then that now Network connects to another Network connects to another Network connects to another Network you can face some FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia you can talk to them at the same time and like you're reaching the same signal so how is it that it gets there so fast we could talk about that by analogy to a road system it's not just one big super highway it's a lot of smaller super highways that are all interconnected and those interchangers are what are called routers that's where the Links come together we're talking about talking to a friend in Australia so oh it's coming in from the east coast of the United States to this router and it's going out say that routers in San Francisco it's going out on an underseized cable over to Australia rather than in this direction up to Japan so there is a undersized cable the underseased cables are so cool they're these big cables that are laid down by switches they cross both the Atlantic the Pacific the Indian Ocean so the underseased cables are how the networks in Europe the United States Asia are are all connected together how do you connect like wirelessly that's really what we call the first hop it's like from your phone from your tablet from the computer that you're on there's no cables coming in you go over a wireless connection Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk to that first top router over a wireless communication link and I was wondering like how there's so many different movies or TV shows that you can download and that they're all there and like if you just play it it just knows what to play they're all in one spot ah you said they're all in one spot in fact they're in lots of spots in Netflix and so most applications would like to connect you with a server that's close to you server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory a lot of disks that store all the Netflix movies and also so that you don't have to cross over too many internet links to get from where the server is to the TV or the device in your home so when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house how does it know exactly what to do without getting scrambled up ah another great question there's a couple of things that could happen inside the internet information is sent in these little packets of information from the Netflix server to your your display device and literally each packet that arrives says this is the first package for Jenna this is the second this is the third this is the fifth this is the fourth and they're reordered for you as a matter of fact your computer will say using the TCP protocol to the server hey I didn't get packet four can you resend it again and again the Netflix server is very happy to send you packet four again the other is the Internet Protocol if you think about sending letters through the US Postal Service how you've got an address on it so every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you has an address on it says this is going to Jenna it's going to the What's called the Internet Protocol address of your device think of all the the range of devices that are hooked up to the Internet it's totally amazing right every single one of them has one thing in common and that is they speak the IP protocol the Internet Protocol that was a great question
3,am a senior at New York University I study computer science have you taken any courses on the Internet or studied it at all I've taken applied internet technology so we've talked about back-end slash front-end Frameworks and libraries things like that okay um so really at the application Level at the application Level for sure I want to ask you a little bit about what you know about the history of the internet have you heard of arpanet for example I have not heard of arpanet okay back into the 1960s there was a research agency in the United States called DARPA the defense Advanced research projects agency actually was called arpa at the time they wanted to build this notion of a packet switching network not a circuit switch Network like a phone network where you get a dedicated path and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links from source to destination so what would package switching enable I'm sure there's something big here for sure there's there's a lot big right and so remember this was a Department of Defense was they wanted to have forms of communication that were very robust that were survivable right packets could all find their own ways be routed differently through the network so if parts of the network failed you could Route Around failures sounds like uh the reason for like a request response type of yeah uh structure so you can sort of see how the network architecture that wasn't designed to be 100 reliable inside the core of the network and had that complexity built into the edges of the network and to me the really cool thing is you you put this infrastructure in place and then all these Super Creative people think about amazing things to build on top of it and you see this proliferation of amazing applications abstraction I think it's the reason why everything spoken like a real computer scientist right you're a computer scientist I'm a computer scientist we talk about apis application programming interfaces right the API for the internet is something called a socket right and a socket simply says I can communicate if I know your internet address you know 128.119.40.186 right that number is the IP address of my server the University of Massachusetts if you know that you can write a program anywhere in the world and send a message and it'll pop out at my end right I will be remembered during that I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet something like that okay well I don't know about the number seven but there's something in the internet that's sort of similar to that it's called the domain name system the dns's role is to translate names like gaia.cs.ums.edu or ibm.com or facebook.com to an IP address so that your application can actually send a message to that name to that named service this whatever quantity of people is is able to have some form of control so that's a great question who do you think controls the internet I'm pretty sure the internet is fairly decentralized okay what does that mean no one Authority holds control over any sort of decisions or destinations so that's that's 98 true right and if you own a network work like your att.com or your verizon.com you can do within that Network you can do what you want right so in that sense the internet is very decentralized that the control of the network is up to whoever owns the network the two percent where you said there's nobody in control there's a little bit of centralized control there's an organization called the internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers its responsibility is to handle as the name I can suggests names and numbers it's that little bit of centralization central Authority that you need when can we see the next tenfold increase in in Wi-Fi speed you know in terms of tenfold speeds of increases depending on what device you're using right now it's available all you need to do is upgrade right so there's the Wi-Fi protocol is called 802.11 and this is sometimes a source of confusion for people how can it be that I've got a connection at 100 megabits per second from our our TV into our router 100 megabits per second not enough package dropping where do they get dropped do you think somewhere in their travel process exactly right and maybe they're dropped in your apartment but much more likely they're dropped because of congestion somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix or the Disney server if you're watching a video and you're home so even though you've got 200 megabits per second on that last hop you don't have 200 megabits per second from the server into your into your apartment I see I'm curious as our conversation sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things about the internet I think that I've sort of realized that it's a the internet is a technology that's dependent upon so many other factors some more in our control some less
4,tell us a little bit about yourself I'm Casper lant I'm a PhD student at Columbia University under Henning Schultz tutelage oh good pronunciation thank you I'm interested in networking iot and sort of what kind of data science you can use with the data sets that you get from such devices one of the things that I designed before starting my PhD with heading was a iot pill dispenser essentially which which pairs with your smartphone which does facial detection and other computer vision controls and can basically tell who's taking some sensitive medication and make sure that they've taken it correctly we have these low power devices they're sort of at the edge is it just connecting them in across a wireless device across a wireless link is that the primary challenge or well I think the primary challenge is that for sure but then an additional challenge is keeping everything configured in the way that you expect it to be configured so for example most iot devices require you when you're configuring them to for you to enter some kind of captive login portal where you connect to a local network that the iot device produces and then you can input your Wi-Fi SSID and password but then say if you were to change the password or the name of your Wi-Fi network or you move to a new place then suddenly everything needs to be reconfigured right because that's a problem that scales linearly right that you don't want the complexity of managing them to go up linearly with that you'd like it to still print stay pretty flat as you start adding right exactly I mean the good thing about iot devices is that they tend to transmit very very small amounts of data we're used to ethernet cables that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second over a wired device what are the typical data rates iot devices I mean not hundreds of gigabits no I mean I would imagine upper bound kb per second lower bound you could see bytes per second just on average but I mean say that you have a temperature sensor running off of your Arduino that's reporting that temperature in your house every minute that's going to be far less than kilowatts per second on average my cinch is you're you're spot on but they'll produce over time a lot of data and that a lot of iot is about Computing on that data that computation happened mostly at the edge or somehow a combination between the edge and something happening in a far away data center well my sense is right now that all that data tends to be centralized because iot devices are usually the commercial products of companies do you think they'll share it not without some persuasion but I I agree that these data have massive massive research value something I'm interested in with my research is collaborating with people who manage these distributed sensor devices and then taking advantage of those data sets and comparing them to say say you were interested in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City figuring out look this Street next to this school is causing decibel ratings above what we mandate and so there needs to be an intervention here I think for a long time the internet hasn't grappled with but now has with iot and also with cellular networks generally is the question of Mobility do you imagine in the future that it might be possible for mobile devices not to always have to connect through the same provider to go from one network to another definitely I mean we're already seeing long-range networks like Laura that can first of all provide access over a much larger coverage area but then also look the same because they're set up to the same specification regardless of where the individual Gateway is
5,good to see you Jim we're in level five now so you're the expert expert I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP the routing control platform being a precursor to software-defined networking and the notion that rather than having protocols actually always compute things that we could compute things in data centers I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect back on that time and sort of the beginnings of sdn and where it's come since then yeah and when we were at ATT the thing we found was frustrating is at T would buy routers and they would come pre-baked with a set of protocols a set of knobs that you could turn if you wanted to influence how the traffic flowed and a set of dials you could read to understand what was going on inside the network right you couldn't directly do what you wanted to do exactly and so we started thinking about earlier work that was done in the telephony network the old telephone Network and there they had the same problem and they had the idea of having a computer running a program tell a distributed set of telephony switches what to do but the idea was like wow it was kind of a revelation like what would that look like if we did that not for the whole internet but at least att's part of the internet so in other words use software instead of distributive protocols to tell the network what to do yeah do you see the softwareization of the internet as a whole happening so so far it hasn't very much I mean basically software-defined networking exists let's say within a single provider backbone or single Cloud providers Network or a single campus there's been some work on doing it at the juncture points between a pair of networks but one other Trend that's happening that makes it more possible is it used to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other do you have access networks getting much closer to say Google or Microsoft or other large Cloud providers where even you might only go through two networks right so some people have called that the flattening of the internet right so I think it used to be on average you would go through 10 different networks to get from a source to a destination exactly and if you take that even further there's starting to be more Edge Computing where you might imagine you might have a cell tower connected to a small number of routers connected directly to a server that's going to be running the application in that case the entire infrastructure might be controlled by a single party it's totally fascinating to me that we have such an important Global infrastructure and yet the laws that that govern it tend to be very very local there are tens of thousands of separately administered networks and of course in hundreds of countries and the fact that it even holds together at all is kind of a miracle right well it holds together because we have standards and we have protocols exactly protocol standards for how the equipment talks to one another and increasingly certificate authorities that help bootstrap the secure encrypted and communication between end hosts so there are a few of these sort of centrally kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure but for the most part each network runs itself and certainly we've heard about some countries that impose firewalls that don't let certain kinds of traffic out or certain kinds of traffic uh in so there's no Global body that is regulating that not really because each country really can have its own laws its own norms and so they can decide like the great firewall of China can decide they don't want to let certain content be accessed by the citizens inside that country so if a country decides they don't want to answer requests for a particular domain name they say hey I don't want to let someone know the IP address of this website they can decide not to let those answers be delivered inside their country and so encryption plays a role in in helping people you know keep their privacy or prevent surveillance but it's not perfect right it's often possible still to to know a fair amount of what people about what people are doing even if you can't look inside the envelope at the letter that's right right I mean even you could just tell that two people are communicating even though the traffic itself is encrypted so you don't know what they're saying just even knowing two devices are communicating exactly and in fact if you look at say the sizes of the transfers that they're doing you may know hey I'm talking to Netflix and by the way this is the the length of the movie I watched and right this is the second confirm or guess a lot of things exactly you're one of the most awesome networking researchers that I know I'm curious just to pick your brain what do you think are some of the Hot Topics in networking research where do you think the field is heading yeah I'm excited about the convergence of Wireless Communications you know cellular networks Wi-Fi with networking and cloud computing and in particular we're seeing in in Edge Computing a convergence of all three or you might have a mobile phone or a drone or some other kind of device connecting over the wireless medium directly to a network that connects you directly to the server that might run your application so you want the computation close to where the where the end point is exactly and I think that what what's now exciting about that is all three of these Technologies Wireless networking and Cloud which are normally three different communities three different sets of Technologies through different sets of Standards or practices now have to work together in close close harmony to be able to serve as applications that are really critical and that might be interacting with the physical world in ways where safety is is a potential concern you know we've had cellular networks now for for 20 30 years so when we hear about 5G what's trumpeted the most is the fact that oh super high bandwidth right but I sense that the exciting things are more than just the network being faster I agree it's both the high bandwidth it's the low DeLay So that you can have these applications that interact with the physical world and need answers in real time it's about having the compute really close so that you can integrate computation and communication it's about having more coverage coming back again to the softwareization sdn and softwareization is a maybe a little bit behind the covers that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going from 3G to 4G to 5G you just see an increase in speed but yet the way the network is now being managed again I think is bringing the cellular networking World sort of into the internet World in terms of the softwareization completely agree management and I think the bringing in of compute and storage is important too I think when you think just about networking it really is often just one part of the it they know the information technology ecosystem as there's often compute and storage as well and so I think now there's an opportunity to have all of those parts of the infrastructure work together towards an even higher level goal and so I think it's a really exciting time to to be in the field because now the plumbing is getting close to the application in a way that it wasn't wasn't before
1,hi I'm Chelsea what's your name Juliet nice to meet you Juliet today we'll talk a little bit about a concept called more of X Paradox what's that something that explains what's hard and what's easy for a robot something like stacking these two cups do you think that's easy or hard if it's this way then it's easy but if it's this way you need to balance it or oh it's still pretty easy right it turns out that stocking these two cups it's actually really hard for robots to do that so let's think about how we might have a robot stock these two cups you could program the robot to move its hand right here and then program the robot to close its hand around the cup and then program the robot to move over here and open it and drop it exactly right just that seemed pretty simple for the robot to do say we even just moved the cup over here do you think the robot would still be able to stack the cups yes we can see what happens so it's gonna We program the robot to move to the same exact position as before oh yeah so it goes to the same place when we gave it instructions Did we tell it to look at where the cup was or did we tell it to just move over here we told it to just move over here exactly so more of EX Paradox is something that means that these really simple things like stocking cups is really really hard for robots even though it's really easy for us while robots are actually really good at really complicated and really difficult things think about the task of multiplying two really big numbers together okay okay does that seem like a hard task or an easy task it's easy for me you either get at multiplying big numbers together yes could you multiply 4 100 by no I can't do that but it's actually really easy for a computer to do that so how fast were you able to stack the two cups like two seconds it took me like a couple of days when I learned how to stack cups yeah but so it took you a couple days when you learned how to stock cups but before that you already knew how to grasp objects right you already knew how to pick out cups and so you could use that when you were learning the stock codes we're trying to be inspired by how humans learn to do tasks to allow robots to do the same kind of things that are very simple for people like stocking cups we want robots to be able to do something like that too
2,what grade are you in I a junior have you heard of something called more Vex Paradox never heard of it typically you would think that things that are easy for humans are also easy for robots and computers to do right and things that are hard for humans should also be hard for robots and humans to do but it turns out that it's actually the opposite I want to try a little demo so I have a penny in my hand and I'd like you to pick it up with your right hand and put it into your left hand so that was pretty easy right yeah we're gonna make this a little bit harder now so can you put these on and we'll try to do the same thing again with your eyes closed foreign there you go let's try that one more time and see if you can do any better so close your eyes oh there we go yeah so that you're with a bit more practice you're able to figure it out when it fell on the ground how did you know to pick it up off the ground from the Sun so when a robot tries to do something like pick up an object not only do you need to program exactly like what the motors should do the robot also needs to be able to see where the object is then this is what's called a perception action Loop in robotics so if the object moves the robot can then adapt what it's doing and change what it's doing to successfully pick up the object it's really important for robots to be able to leverage not just like the past hour of experience but also ideally many years of experience in order to do the kinds of things that you did it's kind of hard for me to understand why like robots can do like all these crazy calculations but they can't do like all the simple stuff so yeah it's really unintuitive in order to survive we need to pick up objects and everything basically many many like billions of years of evolution actually created humans and the ability to manipulate objects like that so it actually turns out that things that are really basic for us are actually just really complex tasks in general so do robots know like they messed up they know that's a great question so in reinforcement learning the robot tries the task and then it gets some sort of reinforcement some sort of feedback similar to how you might train a dog yeah so you could give it feedback like that so it won't necessarily know itself especially on the first few tries but it's trying to figure out what the task is even does a robot see like how we see or does it like just see like a program or something we give robots a camera and the camera produces this array of numbers basically each each pixel has three different numbers one for R for G and for B and so the robot sees this really massive set of numbers and it has to be able to figure out from that massive set of numbers what is in the world there's a number of different ways to have the robot see but we use a technique called neural networks that tries to take in those big numbers and form representations of the objects in the world and where those objects are can a robot ever go off the program it depends on how you program the robot if you program the robot to follow exact emotions and follow a very specific program then it won't go off that program it will always do those actions but if something unexpected happens that the program wasn't designed to handle then the robot might go off course I think robots will take over the world just being honest I think that robotics is really really hard having robots do even really basic stuff like pick up objects is really really hard so if they do take over the world I think it'll be
3,foreign so today we'll talk a bit about Robotics and machine learning and artificial intelligence so have you heard of more of EX Paradox I haven't heard of more effects Paradox yeah that's what it's called yeah yeah I haven't heard of it before it describes something in AI which is that things that are really intuitive and easy for humans are actually really difficult to build into AI systems and on the flip side picking up an object really simple for people but it's actually really difficult to build that into robotic systems so do you have any experience working with robots or other AI systems I did work with robots but they weren't doing like artificial intelligence type of stuff we were just sending like instructions and the robot would do like perform like a simple task I wasn't so used to the aspect of like teaching a computer how to do stuff so I'm always on that other end of like giving instructions more focused on the data analysis and machine learning aspect of it and how would you just describe machine learning like in one sentence I'd say machine learning is giving like feeding data to a program or to a machine and they start to learn based off of that data do you have any thoughts on like what the data might look like in a robotic setting if you were to apply machine learning to robots I think of like coordinates yeah exactly one thing that my research has been looking into is if we can have robots learn from data we'll collect data from the robot sensors if the robot has sensors in its arm to figure out the angle of one of its wrist for example then we'll record that angle and all of the robots experience will go into a data set now if we wanted a robot to solve a task like I don't know picking up a cup and then maybe you want to pick up a different cup if it only had the data of picking up the first cup do you think it would be able to perform well on the second cup I don't think so I feel like that might be a problem yeah so there's this generalization Gap this gap between what it was trained to do and what it the new thing so what's like the most complicated thing for a robot to learn is it visit motion so you can think of robot robotics is having two core components one is perception being able to see and feel and so forth and action where the robot actually figures out how to move its arm and both components are really essential and both components are quite difficult if you train a perception system independently of how to choose actions then it might make errors in a way that mess up the the system that selects actions and so if you instead try to train these two systems together to have it learn perception and action for the goal of solving these different tasks then the robot can be more successful one thing that's really difficult about robotics is there actually isn't that much data of robots in the world on the internet there's all sorts of text Data all sorts of image data that people upload and write but there isn't a lot of data of doing a simple thing like tying your shoe for example because it's so basic one challenge is even just getting data sets that allow us to teach robots to do these simple kinds of tasks do you think that we'd be able to kind of accelerate that process of collecting data or do you think is it the way that we've been collecting those types of data sets is that is that what's keeping us behind that's a great question I think we should be able to accelerate the data collection process by having robots collect more data autonomously on their own and by doing that we might be able to overcome some of the challenges of more of X Paradox what are some common algorithms that are used in these types of techniques as the robot is learning Depot is a common toolbox for addressing some of these challenges because it allows us to leverage large data sets and so deep learning is basically corresponds to methods for training these artificial neural networks another common method that comes up is reinforcement learning a third kind of algorithm is meta learning algorithms and these algorithms learn not just from the most recent experience on the current task but leverage experience from other tasks and and in the past and they're not just completely separate we can combine the aspects of these algorithms into a single method that gets the benefits of each of them what year are you in your PhD I'm just
4,finishing up my first year studying food manipulation and also by manual manipulations and just enabling robots to have these capabilities so that eventually we can use it in like a home robot use case for example what are some of the challenges that you've run into when trying to work with robots and do these tasks so I was really interested in the problem of scooping Peas on a plate they're relatively homogeneous but when it came to more complex foods like broccoli or deformable foods like tofu that can crumble that gets a lot more complex to simulate one thing I find really fascinating about robotics is that the things that are so simple for us like feeding yourself broccoli is so second nature to us are really hard for robotics when you try to take a robot and train it to do a task and simulation and the simulation isn't perfectly accurate it's really hard to actually model the physics of how a tofu crumbles right what algorithms do you think are most promising for handling non-rigid deformable objects and the other things you been looking at for most of my past work which have been relatively more complex tasks I lean towards the imitation learning type of algorithm approach behavioral cloning and all that mostly because if it's hard to simulate an interaction with an object then I think RL is harder to go with because it's not as sample efficient as imitation learning can be and a lot of the times I'll be learning some high level policy of what to do and then hard coding a lot of the like action Primitives that I want to select between my tasks how can we get robots to learn more efficiently or learn faster from my experience it's a matter of how much support you give the like robot when it's learning one could be like a narrower task range another is maybe like also biasing the types of samples that you're collecting can bias towards interactions that are going to be useful where the the hands actually interact with each other rather than just off doing their own things what have you found to be like your go-to's between the different styles I think I have a somewhat similar perspective to you in that if we provide more structure and support and sort of forms of prior knowledge or experience of the algorithm that should make it more efficient and so if we can acquire those kinds of priors about the world and about interaction from previous data Maybe offline data then I think we should be able to make learning of new tasks more efficient it's similar to like skill transfer style of things because some skills are just repeatable like if I know how to pick up a cylinder then maybe I know also how to pick up a mug yeah so you may not transfer the exact strategy or the exact policy that the robot takes but you should be able to learn some general heuristics about performing manipulation there's this gap between the simulators that we have now and what we actually experience in reality so what do you think are promising directions to to try out for actually making our simulations match reality more closely it's a really a really hard problem a lot of simulators they don't simulate the world to Define enough time granularity to really accurately capture things like skewering an object for example one thing that I think is promising is to try to not build simulators entirely from first principles from our knowledge of physics but instead to look at real data and see how real data might inform our simulations and try to build allow robots to build models of the world build simulators of the world Based on data and based on experiences there's a little bit of a chicken and egg problem because if we want to use simulators to get lots of data and we also need data to get good simulators then there there's no way to get around this so when you say building simulators that don't rely on first principles um are you saying like kind of like a learn simulator we have all these videos of humans interacting with the world and that can be your like physics data that you then use to inform when you're building the simulator that's learning based on those videos exactly I think we can use machine learning to learn about physics and to build these kinds of physics simulators that's really cool it's a cool idea 
5,so great to see you Mike thanks for coming it's my pleasure so over the past four levels we've been talking about more of EX Paradox I'm curious to get your perspective there are still a lot of open questions for how to leverage previous experience and learn cumulatively over time you know it's funny because I'm kind of at the heart a developmental psychologist and so when we talk about babies a lot of what we're talking about is how they become human I started to try to build computer models of little tiny bits of babies cognition and I would ask people and they'd say you have to assume that you can recognize objects because actually recognizing objects is impossible and I was like wait it's impossible what about Ai and they're like that's that's really hard why do you think it's so hard to build these things into AI systems and robots I guess if you think about a you know a quintessentially human task like playing chess or solving an arithmetic problem things that other creatures just don't do when you're a human being you have to learn that in cultural time and so there's a limited amount of data you have but if you're talking about seeing the world interacting with the world using your factors properly that's the combination of this massive amount of evolutionary time when you look at that it's like the 56 games of Chess I played in chess club that doesn't look like a lot of training data you work so hard to make a robot do one particular thing or one class of task and then it seems like people must always come up to you and say so okay but what about my other task okay you know you can fold a sock or stack a cup how about you know my dishes that frustrating is that a challenge is it interesting I think it's interesting and also a huge challenge I think that it's interesting that if a person sees a robot doing something that seems very capable they assume that the robot can do all sorts of other capable things it's a huge challenge because that's actually not the case when we think about babies and their social cognition we actually start from the idea that they have a notion of what an agent is an agent is something that's self-propelled that has its own internal States like goals and uh beliefs and so it's very natural to imagine that when you see a you know a seemingly called propulsive uh action by a robot you know you're thinking hey I this thing has a desire it has a goal it's accomplishing it with its so what if I give it a different goal why couldn't it do that um they call it promiscuous generalization about agents right I I think that the electrical outlet looks like a face I think that my computer's mad at me and so so I think it you know the Big Challenge actually is to stop people from doing that and to recognize limitations where there are some where we bring to bear our knowledge sometimes incredibly quickly to parse an uncertain image so uh our experiences go all the way down to our very first impressions of the sensory signal I like that description because it conveys how much complexity there is to these really basic tasks that we're doing is there a definition for the simple tasks that we do versus things that are more complex like playing chess I guess I like to think about this you know hierarchical Cascade you know where at first you know Vision starts with the sensory signal and parses it to gradually more complex units I think it does make sense to talk about lower level meaning closer to sensation and perception and action uh and higher level meaning more deliberative more mediated by memory and language and judgment that notion of hierarchy is really interesting because it is these higher level things like playing chess for example that we that are easier for AI systems and the reason why they're easier is that we're providing the abstraction for the system already when when we give it the the game of chess to an AI system we abstract away all the challenges of like picking up pieces and moving them and we say okay there's this board of however many boxes on it and you just need to figure out um within that very narrow small world what to do but handling and learning what those abstractions should be and handling everything from low-level sensory inputs to that higher level processing is really really hard our impression that it's purely discreet and symbolic might be just that might be an impression because we talk about it in language and actually the fact that it's connected up to all these perception and sensation action systems means that it's probably grounded in a more continuous set of representations I wonder is there going to be a point where what you really want to know is what are the experiences that a human has debroy's human speech-owned project his idea was well I need the exact data that my son gets in order to train my robot to be like my son or do you think that we're going to end up in a world that's more like the large language models and that'll have to do I suspect that we'll start by doing whatever is most convenient because that's whatever we can get but I think that for robots to be capable alongside humans in a world with humans I think that we may need to actually use Human Experience human learning to inform how robots learn if we want them to follow the same kind of mistake pattern as humans so that humans can interpret robots and humans can understand what robots will will and will not do
1,what's your name namina our topic today is quantum sensing so quantum is about the study of stuff that's really really really small and sensing is about measuring so the word sensing comes from kind of like our senses so do you know what your five senses are seeing hearing um tasting and smelling mm-hmm yeah it touches touch exactly so it's kind of really important for us to be able to have these senses so we know what's happening in the world around us right we're doing quantum sensing is we're trying to measure things that can be hard to see let me show you can you see inside it with your eyes no okay can you bounce it for me do you know what makes it bounce i think like inside of it it's foam that's fluffy but my second answer is i think it's very soft that's a great description can we cut one open and see what it looks like yeah i think that's a good idea here's a bowl that's been cut right in half you look inside it's hard this what gives it a certain texture kind of like the texture of like the top of a crayon but you were right that it was like foam it would be really cool if we could see inside the ball without cutting it open right but you could use a magnifying glass and then look at the ball but with the magnifying glass you'd only be able to see it's right near the surface right just you won't be able to see into the middle if you had the right tools you could start thinking about ways to look inside the ball without cutting it open that would then you'd still have your ball we could still play with it yeah it would be cool if we like use something like an x-ray we built an x-ray that was only made for both and you could see everything inside it every single detail you could zoom in and out in it and you could draw it print it out that's exactly the type of thing that we're doing we're sensing is we're trying to measure what's inside with right and do it without destroying the ball yeah for example we want to go inside let's say the human body and see what's happening sometimes we can look under the surface of the earth and see what's underneath it we can make really really precise clocks that will tell us that can measure time really really accurately and we can make very very fine measurements that'll tell us about the rules of science and how the world works around us but we need to build better tools that allow us to do that 
2,our topic today is going to be quantum sensing have you ever heard of it before no no what do you think it might mean if you just break down the words something on a very small scale because of the word quantum the sentencing part i'm not sure so sensing is really just about measuring stuff okay and at some level there's a different set of rules that seem to come into play as you can have particles at very microscopic scales seem to do really strange things but one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale we are really interested in quantum sensors because we think they can give us the ultimate limit of sensitivity so they're really really sensitive to small changes but they're also going to be really reliable every time i make the measurement they'll always get the same results okay measurements on like what kinds of things could be in almost anything you want have you ever had broken a bone i fractured something though okay do you remember having an x-ray yeah x-ray and i have had a few mris before you've had an mri mris before and so both of those are in some ways a form of sensing and they rely on different types of sensing do you know what this image is maybe an mri exactly do you know what an mri how an mri works no i don't and i feel like i should because i've gotten them millions of times and what the mri scanner is doing is it's measuring the signal from all the water molecules that are present and specifically the hydrogen atom in our bodies we have these hydrogen atoms are essentially spinning around magnetic fields all the time and we just don't know them so in some sense you've already used a quantum sensor yeah so our mri is essentially more detailed x-rays they're not so they're giving us different types of information okay so this is an x-ray you don't see any of the soft tissue the x-ray gave us information about the bone yeah whereas mri is giving us information about things like the softer tissues yeah and in fact we don't see the bone very well and yeah so there are slightly different reasons why you would choose a two different things suppose i could have a higher resolution what would you think i would be able to see the different atoms and the structures of the particles start to see the different cells and yeah the different chemicals in the cells if you look at the mri images you can see that they give you the broad features of what the tissue looks like but if you want to zoom in a little bit more and see what's actually happening inside a tissue or inside a cell and you need a different type of sensor it's going to be more sensitive and for something like that you're going to need a quantum sensor are there different types of quantum sensors for different things so one of the quantum sensors that's related to the work that i do is based on these defects they're called nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond and people actually now make nanodiamonds that they can try to put inside the human body to look at the chemistry inside the cell so is that used for drug trials and when testing out new treatments we can do it on tissues right now or on the surface but we can actually do it inside the body so right now we're struggling for which scenarios can we use this to get better information and when can we not do it are there any other quantum sensors at the moment that aren't in the developmental stage anymore that we are using so there are quantum sensors that are sold for very specific applications one of them is a magnetometer and those can be really really sensitive to measure small variations in magnetic fields that are trying to develop sensors that are gravitational sensors right now we have no way of probing what's under the ground without digging into the ground you talked about a sensor measuring magnetic fields what does that help us learn what is that good for well if i want to navigate and i know what the structure of the earth's magnetic fields are in some ways that's how birds uh navigate the avian compass in fact people think of that as a quantum sensor okay so they've got like built quantum centers they have a built-in sensor and one of the ideas is that they're using quantum phenomena to figure out what the direction of the earth's magnetic field is that's why they're able to be the homing pigeons are able to come back yeah operational looking oh that's cool
3,what year are you in i'm a senior i'm studying physics right now cool what do you think of when you hear the words quantum sensing i think that using some sort of quantum computing to sense some quantum level molecules or particles like interactions and stuff maybe is exactly using a quantum phenomena to sense and measure things and the idea is that if i can harness quantum phenomena and i can push the limits that are possible i can get something that's ultimately more precise and potentially more accurate okay how is it more precise we believe quantum mechanics tells us what the true laws of physics are and so a quantum sensor in that sense would reach the limits of what's attainable it would be the top tier it would be the top tier what are what are you doing like what are what are you so i study spins and so spins are one of the platforms that people have suggested is a useful platform for building quantum technologies and i study spins on the solid state and one of the platforms i work on is nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond which is a really nice platform because it the spins show their quantum properties even at room temperature so are you studying the spins of the electrons so in some sense the phenomena we're studying are essentially is nuclear magnetic resonance or electron spin resonance which is a very similar phenomena but uses the spin of the electron rather than the spin of the the nuclei so you mentioned the the diamonds that are used to create the sensors right so how long does it take to make a sensor and and to make that diamond is that created do you like put energy into it or so you can implant nitrogen into a diamond and then you bombard it with electrons to create the vacancies and then you heat it up and anneal it and then you get these nitrogen vacancy centers in your system so you mentioned quantum computing earlier so have you heard of the the idea of superposition yeah so that's in some ways the key to both quantum sensing as well as quantum computing it's the idea that you can take a system and put it in a superstition of two states normally we think of classically a bit can be a zero or a one so switch is either on or off whereas in a quantum system it can be in what's called a superposition so it can be in partially on and partially off but one of the challenges with quantum systems is that these superstitions are really hard to maintain because we don't see superpositions in the world around us at one computer you try really hard to isolate everything so that you can maintain this quantum property and the fact that it's actually going to lose its quantum properties as it interacts with the world also makes it a great sensor because now you're actually that you're using that fact that it's interacting with the world to say wait it's sensing something okay so it's like using like the quantum computer would be kind of like the base level and then like you take it out into the world and see how like it differs so rather than trying to build a lot of complex algorithms and gates with it what you do is you take these quantum bits and you take them out into the world and say what do you see what are you sensitive to so you can use an idea called entanglement to make an even more sensitive quantum sensor but that's even more fragile so there's always this trade-off between being super fragile and being super sensitive how does entanglement um work into it so entanglement is the idea that two particles are correlated they're essentially in the same quantum state so that you can't disturb one particle without disturbing the second particle and so if i have a large number of quantum sensors are entangled then they're all going to interact much more strongly than if i just had one of them interact at a time okay and so that gives you a boost in sensitivity it's more precise absolutely is an atomic clock a quantum sensor in some ways it is and atomic clocks are remarkable devices and being able to measure time that precisely has really important consequences in fact our old gps system is based on the accuracy of atomic clocks certain set of satellites each of which has an atomic clock on board and they send out a time stamp and so once it gets a signal from three different satellites it can triangulate and figure out exactly where you are now if you could make those clocks even more precise you could actually accurately position where you are even more accurately okay that's really cool so some ways you know when atomic clocks were designed and built we didn't necessarily think of gps but technology often works that way is that there are new discoveries and then someone else comes along and says hey this is a great tool for some other application 
4,so what drew you into quantum computing i think what got me into material science was actually making semiconductors for solar panels then that drew me into new types of technology that used semiconductors with the one that's very popular now as quantum computing and what about you what got you interested in quantum sensing i started out doing magnetic resonance study things like bone and biomedical magnetic resonance ended up playing with spins for a long time and the physics of spins just fascinated me so what do you think is a big difference between imaging large biological objects versus sensing very small quantum objects i guess in a way it's part of the same continuum what you're doing is changing the technological platform and you're actually able to probe it more sensitively the resolution you're able to get is much higher so you can see smaller signals in a much smaller volume how is the resolution higher so it's because the the nitrogen vacancy center is a single defect so you can actually see a single electron in normal magnetic resonance you it's you don't have the sensitivity in order to be sensitive to like a single electron do you have to be really close to it you have to be close to it you can detect it optically because if we tried to detect the magnetic moment of the electron we wouldn't be able to do that because there the energy is too low compared to thermal energies but what the diamond system gives you is a natural up conversion energy so you can couple into an optical photon which is then much easier to detect a single optical photon than it is to detect microwave okay i see yeah and that's why it's able you're able to do it at room temperature as well what are some of the challenges you've faced when trying to do quantum sensing with this platform one of the key challenges i think for all any quantum technology is really understanding what limits your coherence times and then the next question that comes up often is how do we make this better if i take a single qubit or a single spin there's a certain limit up to its sensitivity but if i can take entangled spins in principle i could make the system much more sensitive but it usually comes at a cost because when i entangle something it's much more sensitive to decoherence as well in a similar way but maybe even in the opposite way where we want to figure out how to be as resilient from noise and all the kinds of noise sources exactly okay what are you studying i'm studying superconducting qubits they use hybrid semiconductor superconductor structures the semiconductors are you introducing new noise sources potentially that might affect the coherence times yeah yeah so the big one is charge noise because i guess a lot of the superconducting qubits they have made them in such a way that they're insensitive to charge exactly so when you think of noise in what way it is is a noise bad for your system i usually think of it like well we work with quantum systems yeah and those are very sensitive to fluctuations i guess any fluctuations can kick your quantum system either out of the state that it's in to another state i think as you said you know anything that interferes with my signal is noise but it can come from different sources in some ways the operation of the quantum system itself as it's sensitive to different physical phenomena the ones that i don't like i call noise the ones i do like i call signal and that's an artificial definition that i'm making when i choose to build a sensor one of the challenges we have is we're trying to figure out if i want to control it where is it coming from i remember we had experiments running in our lab one day and we were running these experiments about 100 megahertz all of a sudden we saw these big spikes coming in and we realized we're picking up the local fm stations and that was a source of noise like it's completely random but it is still there and then the other form is very much what is intrinsically within your experiment itself because some of the materials that you have have defects that are coupling into your sensor into your quantum system and are also producing noise but yeah the interesting stuff really is where you're picking up the quantum noise from intrinsically from whatever right it could give you information if you read it out about what's happening or you have to find smart ways to suppress it so that you can focus on what you really do care about so what are the kind of noise and fluctuations that you're worried about so one of the things that we're interested in is looking at suppose i want to build an entangled quantity sensor when i put a number of spins together in addition to being sensitive to an external field they're sensitive to each other and they start talking to each other you don't just see the external spins you see the fluctuations of all the other spins in your system so what you want to do is make sure that they don't interact with each other but they still stay sensitive to everything else and there you could think about the local interactions the magnetic interactions between the spins as a form of noise in some ways it's interfering with what you want to measure which is the magnetic field outside the sample
5,so our topic today is quantum sensing which you're an expert on can you recap for us in your perspective what is quantum sensing that's that's a million dollar or maybe a billion dollar question exactly yeah i think a lot of people in the field have different definitions for it absolutely what would you want to be like the smoking gun of a quantum sensor depends on who i'm talking to right you know trying to talk to students and get them excited or you know try to talk about the elements of quantum mechanics i think maybe we could agree that you know things that use superposition have a certain degree of of quantum mechanics quantum yes involved maybe they should be using elements of quantum computation so i don't have a strong view on it but i do think it's an interesting question i would tend to agree that i think in some sense all anything that uses superposition could be quantum sensor but then spectroscopy uses superpositions and has been around for 60 70 years i think what excites me most now is the idea that can we push the boundaries of how sensitive one can make this technique how improving sensitivity specificity what other limits and as we define it better are there fundamental physical limits that's where the excitement lies is when we really start to leverage having you know access to individual quantum degrees of freedom whether that's a single photon or a single spin and in principle then you could also imagine entangling it and you know doing some quantum computations on it in order to make it an even better sensor so do you think there's a maximum number of spins you can have if i think about a single nv as a register right i mean people have thought about this it's an interesting question you can think about you have the electron and it's surrounded by some nuclei and you could change the density of those nuclei and so if it's a lot more dense then you have a lot more that are strongly coupled yeah but you also have a lot more noise but i i don't know that there's necessarily a limit i mean it's been it keeps expanding i mean i think that there are some groups that are able to identify you know 30 40 individual nuclear spins around a single a single electron and control 10 or 15 of them so do you think you can integrate multiple nv centers on multiple optical sensors so are there ways in which you can overcome this question of there's a spot size and that limits how many nvs i can pack into a certain region that's another great question a couple of groups actually that are working on trying to read out the spin state of nv centers uh electrically instead of optically if you could do that then you could pack a whole lot more into a smaller space using tiny electrodes and you could possibly have them spaced at nanometer scales instead of at micron scales and i think the application there is clearly sensing right right do you think they'd retain their coherence times if you pack them in yeah what's limiting the coherence is really local right you know nanometer scale but it happens to be that most of the time when we try to read them out with light well then the trouble is that the diffraction limit of light is you know hundreds of nanometers and so then we need them to be apart but you know if you have two envy centers that are more than a couple tens of nanometers away from each other they just don't talk to each other yeah so from that point of view the technology could be really dense right which is why you know some you know companies or groups are trying to make quantum computers based on spins and semiconductors because they could be really densely integrated using modern technology but the question for a sensor is as you say how do you address it how do you initialize it how do you read it out and is optics the best way to go it may not be if we think about uh quantum sensing in particular it really involves understanding materials um solid-state materials chemicals you know chemistry biology engineering electrical engineering optics photonics i mean so many different areas i think that that's one of the most exciting things about that is the degree to which it's engaging a much larger cross-section of scientists they're the ones that i think are going to come up with the breakthroughs of saying oh wait i could design this molecule to do this thing yeah and that i think is going to make real breakthroughs in the next 10 years is the fact that we're just having this much larger group of scientists people bring in very different perspectives into what used to be a very niche feeling i remember physics you'd only talk to people in your subfield and now we're picking up the phone and talking to people in the different departments completely different areas and we're forced to learn different languages the quantum world is essentially the world of very small but one of the quests of quantum sensing is to harvest some of these unique properties at the micro scale and with these tools we will be able to have new technologies and new measurements that we are unable to make today
1,what's your name myra have you heard of fractals before um no absolutely not so a fractal is something that we see every day but it's a little bit hard to describe it's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away or you look at it really up close it has kind of a similar appearance and actually that word fractal sounds a little bit like fraction right so actually fractals are in some way fractions but for shapes have you ever seen a movie called moana yes yeah moana lives on this like beautiful island right this island has lots of trees on it some artists had to make all those trees how do you think they do that they um try to find something similar to that on the google and they try to picture it in their head saying what would what would it look like if they it was animated so somehow they have to explain to the computer what a tree looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them yes and that's kind of what we're gonna try out today in fact we're gonna have you build a fractal a tree is a really good example of a fractal because if you look at the whole tree and then you break off a big branch of the tree yes it almost looks like that branch that you broke off is itself another tree so our rule is that every branch splits into two smaller branches okay so your tree is totally beautiful but it took a long time to make right how would you feel if i said now you have to make a thousand of those trees i'd be like oh my that's a lot of work yeah it's a ton of work if you think about moana's island it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it and that's why we need computers to help us out because computers are really good at taking these really simple rules like put two branches on every other branch and doing it really really fast i want to know how to draw a fractal on a computer if you want to learn to draw fractals then you might need to learn a little bit about programming programming like coding like coding exactly that's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are working with code rather than with a paintbrush so in your own words how would you describe a fractal to somebody i would describe a fractal by saying that when you see a object if you'll zoom in closely you'll see that it's it's broken down into pieces so as you zoom in more closely you'll keep seeing smaller and smaller pieces definitely that is totally what fractals are all about yes
2,what are you studying in seventh grade these days i think we're doing geometry so what if i told you that there are shapes where you can't measure the length of the perimeter it's big but um all of the sides are kind of like so weird that they wouldn't be able to pinpoint anything specific to add together the shape is just super super complicated and so you can't actually measure the length yeah right yeah so that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is it has some really really interesting detail at all scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities like lengths and areas and volumes would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal yeah so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface of an asteroid each one of those little wrinkles adds a little bit to the surface area and so it's really hard to say what is the area of an asteroid let's take a look at a little example of where fractals actually show up in nature what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to say what the length of the coastline of great britain is so we're going to start out with the blue ones which are spaced further apart we're going to ask you to connect the blue pins with a piece of string so we can get a measurement of the coastline so we have our first measurement of the length of the coastline and we're going to do it over again but this time we're going to use the white pins which are spaced closer together so we measured the coastline again and what do you think happens there's more in and out therefore probably takes more strength for this one i think i agree with you but i think to really validate our scientific experiment we should probably compare the length of the string a lot of extra slack in that ping string so what we noticed with great britain is we were never able to measure its length it just kept getting longer and longer this is called the coastline paradox where there's not really one definite number you can assign to the length of the coastline but it depends on how you measure it like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate we might have to like actually go down the beach and start measuring these tiny little details along the coastline but really there's so much detail we would probably never get a definite answer for how long the coastline is fractals also give us a really nice language we're talking about how smooth or rough some kind of shape is and actually a lot of people engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals in this language of fractals to compare different shapes not in terms of their size but in terms of their roughness so based on everything we talked about today how would you describe a fractal to somebody in your own words it's a shape that you can't describe as a shape yeah totally like it's a shape that you can't use sort of the ordinary language that we use to talk about shapes you really need some other ideas or concepts to talk about
3,do you play any video games um i really like hearthstone minecraft what happens in minecraft if you get really really close to a shape well it just looks like a block yeah it looks really blocky and it's the same thing not only with shapes and games but also colors and textures and this is an especially big problem in virtual reality because you have no control over where people are going to go what they're going to look at how close they're going to get to various objects so fractals on the other hand are these things that have infinitely you know nice detail as you get closer and closer and closer and so this is something that can help us solve this problem in computer graphics of generating more detail one of the reasons why fractals are really nice for computer graphics is because the algorithms that we use to draw images also have this kind of recursive flavor what's recursion recursion is a function that uses itself or calls itself in its definition and basically with that you can figure out my new details such as searching for a value in a binary tree it's kind of like iterating through itself but it's often more sophisticated in that it's easier to write they're easy for a computer to execute right it just has to run this recursive procedure over and over and over again we can kind of get as much detail as we want or need when i think about fractals and kind of what they've done for computer graphics the example i think is subdivision surfaces did you did you encounter subdivision surfaces in your graphics class at um the name doesn't really ring a bell so subdivision surface is a way of describing a smooth shape on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape so meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these flat polygons with kind of sharp edges and so the question is how can i get something nice and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons what i can do is i can start cutting one at a time the corners of this paper off it still looks very angular i still have these really sharp points right why are we doing this because i want to draw a smooth curve on the screen but all my computer can do is draw straight lines and that's actually too true of gpus it's kind of interesting gpus are basically really fast machines that can only draw one thing and that's a flat triangle and so if we keep doing this with our paper you kind of get pretty quickly the idea what's going to happen so when you go to see a pixar movie for instance every surface has been subdivided down so you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that are even smaller than the size of a pixel how long does this process take well because people really need to use these uh subdivision services for everything people worked hard over the years to make this super super fast in fact subdivision services were invented basically at pixar there's this guy ed catmull and he was partially responsible for one of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called catmo clark subdivision services and in fact recently won the turing award for these subdivision services what do you think are the current shortcomings in i guess applying fractals to computer science right now what is what is the cutting edge so we've talked a little bit about the positive features of fractals and procedural graphics which is you can write one simple recursive program and the computer creates a lot of detail for you so that's really nice right it's saving you a lot of work but the downside is you lose a lot of control so because the only thing you're describing is this short little program you don't have complete control over how this is going to end up and so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is something people have been thinking about for many years so how has our conversation changed your understanding of what fractals are all about i think it's really interesting to see the different ways fractals will be not only useful but necessary in being able to render these games and these different programs that are interesting in the metaverse or different media to be really beautiful
4,of course it's a pleasure i'm happy to be here do you have any sense of how you would give a really precise mathematical definition to you know what is a fractal it would probably have to be some kind of recursive definition like imaginary numbers i know the mandelbrot said we'll use those the mandelbrot set or the julia set you know the idea is always oh i'm going to apply some polynomial over and over again z squared plus c or something like that when i think about fractals i try to get away from these very specific examples and ask what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal of fractal and one thing that i think you can be precise about even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension have you ever heard of that no i have not actually so if you look at this this piece of paper what would you say the dimension is well on the on the paper itself i would say it's two dimensional but the actual paper would be three dimensions because it has a very small thickness yeah great so so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness but when we model this mathematically we might ignore the thickness and say yeah this is really just kind of a two-dimensional sheet of paper and then you have your apple how many dimensions is the apple i would also say three and y three because it has the height and the width and uh there's a depth to it as well totally now as a little experiment take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball so what is it is the paper three-dimensional or is it two-dimensional it changed in dimensions depending on how it is shaped so it's not quite as solid as the apple but it's also not quite as two-dimensional as the original sheet of paper and so for this reason people associate this crumpled ball with a fractal dimension maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three there are a lot of different definitions precise definitions of fractal dimension but i think the one that's easiest to understand is this thing called box counting dimension you have let's say an image and you want to decide what's the fractal dimension of this image so what you're going to do is you're going to count the number of boxes or you can imagine big pixels of this image that cover the boundary of this shape and you're going to see how does that counting compare with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape so so if i have a straight line and i start out with one big box that covers the whole line and now i shrink my boxes by a factor of two i just make boxes half as big how many boxes will i need to cover that line and if i cut that box in half again how many boxes do i need to cover the line a four but if you take a more interesting shape some kind of fractal shape like let's say the coastline of great britain and you start doing this box counting experiment something really interesting happens as you make these boxes smaller the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows faster than it would for just a straight line yeah i've i've heard about that where if you if you change the amount of measurements that for a coastline you can actually change like how much of the coast that there is but if you measure in mile lengths you're going to get a much different estimate than if you measure in one inch increments and so what this box counting is getting at is saying well i still can never decide what the length of the coastline is but what i can do is i can see how quick does the number of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just for an ordinary one-dimensional curve like a line or a circle is there any other interesting applications of fractals so procedural computer graphics which kind of came out of thinking about fractals is one answer to this question about how do you add more detail without for instance consuming tons of memory or requiring artists to paint ultra detailed textures so if if you can instead describe at least some aspect of what you're looking at in a procedural or recursive way then you can add as much detail as you need when you get close to objects do you mean like perlin noise yeah like perlin noise is a great example right perlin noise was one of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture at any level of detail that you needed to make things look natural and realistic i have a random question do you know how the research into fractals began you can look pretty far back in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea of fractals in science in the 19th century people were trying to look for examples of things in mathematics that were very unnatural so there was for instance this guy named georg cantor who was showing that you can have these sets with really strange properties or you can have functions with really strange properties this thing called the devil's staircase and so on and it wasn't until about a century later where someone named mandelbrot said oh actually this strange mathematics that was meant to show how unnatural things can happen is actually a perfect description of things that really do happen in nature and from there people really ran with it and said oh okay well if these fractal descriptions are good for nature we can also use that for creating really realistic and believable pictures in
5,i can say that when you reached out to me and i first learned about this program i immediately went to my computer and i implemented yet another version of like zooming into the mandelbrot set yeah just because i was so excited you know so that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes a kid at home who's like 13 and 14 who just starts playing around with a simple computer program can make incredibly beautiful fractals yeah and i think that's one of the things that's exciting about it or you don't even need computers like i remember when i was a kid i played electric guitar and i had all these guitar pedals with different effects and oh what happens if you put the output back in the input and just run it through itself you're going to start hearing this kind of fractal sound right so today we've been telling people fractals are things that are somehow self-similar they have detail at all scales are there other ways you might introduce fractals to somebody or are there other things you might say this is what a fractal is i think you could get to the reasons why does a coastline look like a coastline at all different scales it's because the forces of nature tend to work similarly at all different scales and it's those forces that are doing very very simple things over and over and over again that are constantly creating the sense of detail i think about like the scale and variance of different physical equations like navier stokes is you know kind of scale invert you know this reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior at all different scales and that's why you get turbulence at all different scales i actually actually remember the moment when i finally figured out how to make turbulence in computer graphics i was working for this company magi and disney was working on a movie i think it was weird science where they wanted to have a marble vaz and then about three in the morning i was at a diner nearby and i was pouring the cream into the coffee and i was watching it and i started watching it swirl around and i realized that what was happening was really simple the you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and it folds and then the folds get caught up and then that folds again and it's a really simple process of folding within folding and i just went to the computer and did that yeah and things look like marble and look like flame and they look like clouds and they look like you just keep using those simple techniques yeah and i think it's really cool that this kind of fractal description of geometry or physics is also kind of baked into the nature of computation computation is recursive kind of by its nature and so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen to build these machines that also right you know behave the way that you just have to understand recursion exactly somebody once told me in order to understand recursion you just have to understand recursion there you go and then you get it all yeah but i think it's this point that that point with the coffee is important because the forces were operating at one scale they were operating at the scale of the coffee cup but over time they kept making details are smaller and smaller process at one scale plus time you get fractals i think that's also what's so beautiful about fractals is that you know if you think about sort of the history of geometry as well felix klein was looking at geometry by saying well geometry is all about invariance i have some group of transformations and i look at objects that are sort of invariant with respect to these transformations so if you just look at translations okay what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations well you get tiling you get wallpaper and if you start asking that same question what if i allow scaling in my transformations then boom you have fractals immediately come out of nowhere and everybody understands scaling scaling is a simple thing yeah now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality and augmented reality and extended reality but it's kind of interesting because i think if i think about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes in some way they still feel a little bit lonely or they feel a little bit poor of the kind of richness that we have in the real world this is where uh machine learning um starts coming in because you can start saying okay this is a very very rich virtual world but it's informed by you know my favorite mountains that i saw in italy once so you can start training these fractal worlds on things about the real world that have particular emotional resonance for us people outside of computer graphics and engineering and science and so forth have also thought a lot about and used fractals as a language for talking about nature for characterizing shapes and behaviors and so forth tissue or friction or all sorts of really important phenomena do you think that computer graphics has kind of dropped the ball in terms of saying you know this is not something that's exciting anymore to work on procedural uh descriptions and we're moving on from that well i mean if you look at any hollywood movie or you look at any of the game worlds that people are spending all their time in they're highly procedural they have to be and they have to make use of fractal techniques because it's basically a way to get enormous complexity without having to explicitly store the complexity and because they're able to use these relatively simple fractal techniques to make very complex looking natural things right lazy evaluation we love being lazy in computer graphics well it's also it's not even possible to explore to store an entire world in your computer absolutely you want to be able to sort of generate it on the fly i'm looking forward to things getting better we're not there yet so one of the things i guess that touches on is this question about controllability or the ease of with which everybody can create these worlds not just people not just mathematicians not just you know trained computer scientists one thing when i think about ken muskraves working about this program bryce this one i felt like i could really use what do you think we still need to do in terms of putting these kinds of tools in in people's hands making it easier for people to use proceduralism machine learning to build these kind of worlds i think in that case it came down to the fact that ken in particular had a mission to make accessible tools for people without sacrificing the power and the richness of making beautiful things i mean in a sense he was kind of the computer graphic bob ross so he made the land of happy little trees yeah yeah which i mean when you when you think about the techniques of somebody like a bob ross um they're fractal yeah i think this is what what's so beautiful also about mandelbrot's work is him saying you know it's not really about these exotic examples like even the mandelbrot set or julia sets or whatever yeah they're like really interesting mathematical curiosities but they get at this idea that fractals are kind of inevitable and bob ross probably never as far as i know never sat down and you know thought about recursive descriptions of trees or anything like that but it's just something that naturally comes to you as an artist well i mean you can go back to all the classic artists vinci's notebooks were just full of like this thing looks like that thing at completely different scales so he didn't have a fancy word for it but he completely understood it yeah it's really part of human nature or humans connection to nature yeah
1,hi hi welcome tell me your name jude i wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of a black hole yeah i think that they're scary and cool because you can get sucked and get lost forever and get plopped out in a random place it's like a big giant black thingy so black holes you describe them as huge the interesting thing about black holes is they're hugely heavy but they're actually physically really small what really matters is the density do you know what density is it's not weight but it's how much of it is in it here let me show you something i can ask how heavy it is i can also ask how big it is which is a question about its volume if i make it smaller then what's happening is it's becoming more dense so imagine i crushed this really really small it would weigh the same it would have the same mass but it would be much more dense how does it go that small if a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova what's left begins to collapse under its own weight and if that's heavy enough the core will not be able to stop collapsing because it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel it's run out of fuel and if it's run out of fuel it's no longer shining and pushing outward and without that it itself begins to go dark and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore and that's when you form a black hole so if like the sun all collapsed on itself it would form a black hole well that's a really good question so interestingly the sun itself isn't heavy enough so it has to be heavy enough that when it begins to collapse it just overcomes all attempts to fight it if you made something really dense you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to actually escape that's 300 000 kilometers per second well it goes so fast that there's it's all dark so it goes so fast that it goes completely dark any light that veers too close will fall in will not be able to make it back out again if a light is shining from the sun near a black hole buckle's not touching it why does the light get pulled in why does that happen because the black hole is taking other stuff it is taking other stuff but the funny question was like if i wanted to move your chair you'd think it was really strange if i didn't have to come near you and actually grab the chair and move it one of the things einstein thought about is he imagined that what the black hole is doing is it's changing the shape of space around it what do you think of that idea that's crazy isn't it crazy and then einstein goes a step further and thinks well what black holes must be doing is curving the space so strongly that even light gets caught sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit literally the light going round and round in an orbit so black hole it doesn't attract light it moves the space so that the curve is pointed towards it that's right we've been talking for a little while about black holes what are you going to walk away with in your impression of what a black hole is it's kind of curved in space that are all coming to one point everything that goes on those curves changes directions to come in and even light can't escape it nothing can you said that very beautifully does that feel like a different idea of a black hole than the one you had before we spoke yeah a lot
2,have you heard about black holes yes i know it has a lot of mass but it's very small i know that there are several theories about the universe due to black holes like around the universe and how it's made so a lot of times stars are born together in two star systems and when they die if they're heavy enough they will collapse under their own weight and form a black hole so here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star and what will happen is it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star literally parts of the star will begin to spill onto the black hole and splatter on the black hole but let's say both those stars formed black holes and what these black holes do is they are like mallets on a drum they create literally waves in the shape of space-time as they're moving so imagine now it's on a drum how the drum ripples depending on how the mallets are moving you hear different sounds so effectively these black holes as they get very close together in the final stages of their life together they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second it's just really crazy event but it's happening in complete darkness eventually they bobble together and they merge and then they ring out the space times going crazy around them it's the storm in space-time and they settle down to a quiet black hole then those waves that they created travel through the universe basically undisturbed for a long time people thought well even if black holes are out there they're impossible to observe and then they got very clever you might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes that sounds crazy so i'm going to show you but i'm going to need your help this demo involves an electric guitar do you play at all a little bit you want to do the demo for me so the ligo instrument electronically records the ringing of the shape of space with this very complicated instrument it stands for laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory and the design was incredibly difficult and they didn't know if they would succeed i think of the instrument as like the body of the electric guitar and then they take the readout of the motions of the waves that they're recording just like that guitar is recording the motions of the waves on the string i just play it like a little bit and you can't hear anything right you're not meant to hear an electric guitar when it's not plugged in what's happening is the guitar strings are ringing but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound and this is like the gravitational waves which are ringing the drum of space-time but so quietly that they're not moving the air and we're not hearing them so now play and i'm going to turn the volume up a little bit while i can't actually hear the ringing of the strings themselves i can hear the data of the shape of the string recorded and played through this amplifier and that's kind of the idea behind the ligo instrument how do you know that it's like the black hole that's making that sound and nothing else it's a great question if i didn't see you playing the guitar i would recognize the sound of a guitar and even if i'd never heard of a guitar before i could figure out the frequencies that the string was playing i could tell how strongly it had been plucked and i could tell the length of it and where it was pinned down from the harmonics of the string and i can tell the different lengths of the strings from the notes that they play so i can actually reconstruct the instrument that's playing it and it's very similar to lego we can listen to the notes the amplitude the harmonics and we can deduce the size and shape of the objects doing that and they're very massive and they're very small and they have all the markings of a black hole is there anything that like gets affected on earth because of those waves it's a really good question only this instrument and that's why it was so hard to build and by the time it gets here it's so weak that it's only squeezing and stretching space at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances has your understanding of black holes changed over the course of our conversation i knew there were waves for like everything but i never thought specifically oh yeah black holes have like waves i know more and less i know what you mean
3,i'm jada it's nice to meet you nice to meet you and where are you studying i'm a senior at nyu i'm studying physics and environmental studies what is your impression of what a black hole is so it's a star that has collapsed it has so much concentrated mass and gravity that there's a point outside of the black hole called the event horizon so once you get past the event horizon nothing not even light can escape from that so that's a great definition and i want to pick that apart a little bit so what you described is just right stars when they run out of thermonuclear fuel are going to collapse under their own weight it'll explode in a supernova it'll leave a core and if the core itself is heavy enough it will keep collapsing it does as you say reach this point where not even light can escape but the amazing thing is it leaves that point you called it rightly the event horizon it leaves it behind kind of like an archaeological record because the star itself can no more sit at the event horizon then it can race outward at the speed of light so this core of the star keeps collapsing and where it goes nobody knows so in a weird way the black hole isn't any more a crush of matter it left it behind in its wake but the stuff of the star is gone i've heard of short shield black holes which is a black hole that is static a curved black hole or a ker newman black hole which is a black hole that rotates but what makes a black hole static versus rotating and what's more common it turns out that there are only three quantities that define a black hole its electric charge its mass and its spin so the most general black hole can also spin and it can also be electrically charged whether or not they are has to do with how they formed if a star collapses it will likely be spinning when it collapses and the remnant black hole that forms will likely be spinning a black hole of a certain mass charge and spin is indistinguishable from any other black hole with those same properties so in some sense they're like fundamental particles which makes them absolutely exceptional for any other astrophysical object have you heard the stories about what happens inside a black hole i remember that once you pass the event horizon space becomes time and time becomes space in like a coordinate sense so from the outside if you're an astronaut you're watching your friend another astronaut who going into the black hole it's as though your times become rotated relative to each other so the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside looking at this round event horizon you think of the center of black hole as a point in space but to the person who's fallen in it's not a point in space at all it's a point in time the singularity or the the end of it all the crush in the center of a black hole is in their future so they can no more avoid the singularity then you can avoid the next instant of time coming so the death and the singularity is inevitable although we don't really think the singularity necessarily exists i sort of know what a singularity is i think of it as something where everything is compacted into one single point it's a place where the laws of physics don't exactly work out what did you mean when you said that you don't think the singularity really exists so the singularity is definitely predicted in einstein's general theory of relativity and that's purely a theory of space-time and in the theory of space-time there is no question that a singularity would form when the star collapses catastrophically inside the black hole now even when people talked about singularities back in the 60s they thought you know quantum mechanics is part of the story of the whole of physics it's not just gravity because if we understand quantum gravity we'll realize that singularity probably doesn't ever actually form so since we obviously have never been to a black hole um how do we know for sure like what happens after you cross the event horizon or what happens inside a black hole is it just like inferred from the math i would say to some extent we don't know for sure what we have found is that the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful that we're able to disprove wrong ideas just in pen and paper just very recently within the past couple of years the first ever human procured image of a black hole showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon so jada after our conversation today what would you say a black hole is something that i had never thought of before is a black hole as kind of a type of quantum fundamental particle i've also learned how the event horizon of a black hole kind of hides a singularity the beauty of being a student of something like black holes is you never stop having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is so in a year i'll tell you what i learned that's new awesome
4,and you're getting your phd what what year are you i'm a second year so i'm measuring star formation histories in the small and large magellanic clouds does the large magellanic cloud have a big black hole so i think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no but my answer honestly is i'm not sure yeah and probably nobody is have you heard a lot in your studies about these supermassive black holes that we think lurk in the centers of very nearly every galaxy so i don't study agn a lot but i do have a long term interest in black holes it's one of the reasons i entered the field i always was curious about how a black hole of that size was able to form was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes ultimately creating a gravitational well deep enough to contract a proteogenic disk for a whole galaxy or man man what happened yeah i think it's a really good question the only mechanism that we know for sure can form black holes as a collapse of very massive stars so it's sensible to think well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe collapsed under their own weight and then they merged and after some time they got big enough but the black holes from stars can be tens of times the mass of the sun maybe hundreds of times in the mass of the sun if they merge to get to millions and billions and if you just do the simple arithmetic of how many years that would take there aren't enough years in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime so they must have come from somewhere else i am at a loss to think of what could have possibly happened in between the start of the universe and the formation of our galaxy that could create such a massive object yeah i think that's right i think people are really perplexed about how you make something so big in such a short period of time it's kind of funny the bigger you make a black hole it seems maybe counter-intuitive but the less dense the material has to be out of which you make it so you can out of something the density almost of air you can make a supermassive black hole you can't make a star out of that but weirdly if you skip the star phase altogether it's conceivable that they directly collapse and so there's a suddenly a new way to make black holes that nature is figured out we spend all of our time when we learn about black holes in school predominantly through star collapse yeah i didn't even realize that there was an alternate route to creating a black hole there might be many alternate routes it might be in the very early universe that bubbles in unusual phase transitions from very high energy universe to a low energy universe can make black holes like we haven't really thought of the range of possibilities and so there could also be primordial black holes that are still around that that also skipped the star stage altogether that were formed really in the very earliest phases and i think the interesting thing is with you're looking at like the large magellanic cloud is to wonder if we're going to merge absolutely we thought the canonical picture of the clouds was essentially that they had formed with the milky way maybe in its halo and had been in a stable orbit for about a hubble time or about 14 billion years young guns in the field have thrown a wrench in that theory that they've always been orbiting and that perhaps they're on their first orbit they're on an unstable orbit will they join us can you tell us about andromeda andromeda is part of the big three in the local group the local group being a group of galaxies that are not expanding with the expansion of the universe away from each other they're trapped gravitationally by all friends yes they're all friends and andromeda is one of the few galaxies that is traveling towards us and we are due for a merger event at some point so given a sufficiently low velocity we would just have two big galaxies that for the most part pass through each other pass by each other but given a sufficiently high velocity we will have some crazy black hole interactions and some crazy star interactions but when we do merge with andromeda presumably our black holes will emerge and andromeda indeed has a very big black hole as well at its center and then we'll have this just gigantic super massive yeah and it's very possible that as you said the collision won't be so severe that it'll be very disruptive so our entire solar system could stay intact and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets in orbit around a new black hole they're kind of misunderstood giants in a way so i was curious have you heard anything new or interesting in the field of black holes that will shape future discussions we work a lot right now on thinking of black holes as batteries so a black hole that can take like a giant magnet astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star like a neutron star and flip it around so fast near the speed of light that it actually creates an electronic circuit out of this moving magnet and so that the power that can come out of these electronic circuits created by these batteries can be tremendous you know i know that at a certain point for our civilization to become sufficiently advanced to travel the cosmos beyond you know the moon or mars we may have to be able to harness the power of our sun would it be similarly possible to harness the power of a black hole like you were mentioning to travel it's a great question i once did a calculation of using a black hole made out of the moon and the strongest magnet we could find on earth to see if i could make an electronic battery and honestly you only get about enough energy to power new york city but we have to find one in our neighborhood first yeah wouldn't it be my favorite thing so claire we've had this pretty fascinating conversation about supermassive black holes in particular and after our discussion what is it that has changed for you in your perspective and what is it that excites you so i think our discussion kind of exposed a piece of black holes that i don't think of often which is that they're not just life takers they're life-givers and they inform a lot about not just how a galaxy is destroyed or made but how it's shaped and how it eventually you know builds life like ours so maybe i have to give black holes a
5,hi dan i'm so glad you could make it what have you been working on with black holes in the time since i've last seen you there are a lot of aspects to black holes the one that's kind of interested me most lately is trying to understand them from the point of view of information how information is stored and processed and recovered from black holes which turns out to be a really interesting perspective talk us through hawking's initial revolution that led to a lot of these conversations about the information around black holes hawking's big insight was that he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics and the rules of gravity to really understand how black holes behaved but hawking took a point of view where he brought quantum mechanics into the game he realized that if you took that into account that it's actually not quite true that black holes are black that actually things can escape from black holes so what you're describing is the famous hawking radiation where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy from the quantum vacuum and radiates and then the process evaporates and of course it's caused a big kerfuffle because when the black hole evaporates eventually that event horizon is yanked up and the question is is where did everything go that had once fallen in a way to think about hawking radiation is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles are appear out of the quantum vacuum and the particle can escape the black hole but the antiparticle falls in but the particle and antiparticle are repaired and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole and is destroyed at the singularity that poor particle outside the black hole has lost his partner it also violates the rules of quantum mechanics if you have two particles that are entangled that has to be preserved now to be clear nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate that hawking radiation is a solid prediction the black holes should in fact evaporate that's not disputed right that's right it would be wonderful if we could have some experimental evidence for this if we could really build a black hole in the lab and and test to see whether it behaves this way but i think there is hope that we'll be able to detect some of these effects either indirectly by looking at black holes out in the universe or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory by looking at systems which aren't black holes but which radiate in kind of similar ways there's this domain of black holes in astrophysics where we see stars collapse and we know that they exist and there's whole observational astronomy around them and then there's this domain that we're talking about where as you said black holes are so special because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction to understand the very nature of reality and that makes them really unusually special one of the things i wanted to draw out is that we talk about the fundamental forces of nature so there's the matter forces and then the outlier is gravity we've quantized all the matter forces in a way that we're rather comfortable with gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself and now we're thinking in a way that you're describing that well maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether the pursuit of quantum gravity has taken us to places we never expected to be i think what's exciting about physics about theoretical physics that you start following a thread you start developing a chain of logic and you never know where it's going to end up do you think there's ever a hope that the kind of information that you think about the quantum gravity aspects of the universe that you think about whether it will pan out or not will ever be viably observed in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon it's a real challenge but astronomical observations have gotten so fantastically precise and there is some hope that if you looked at things like two black holes merging each black hole comes in with its own event horizon but then when the black holes merge there's a very complicated process where these two event horizons merge and oscillate and vibrate and then settle down into a single event horizon for the final black hole there is some hope that if we can make sufficiently detailed observations of this process if we could really see the way the event horizon is behaving as it settles down to this final state that maybe that could reveal some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about it is amazing in the numerical simulations of two black holes merging you really see the event horizons bubble around and we were talking earlier about how really black holes are flawless they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections and so you can so quickly watch the system ring away that misshapen merger and it comes out in the gravitational waves which is literally the ripples in the shape of space-time until it settles down and then it's utterly flawless again it's really happens fast it's quite amazing yeah it's a spectacular process
1,what's your favorite subject i'd say math some of these small problems can actually be really big and complicated it's like a puzzle i love math for the same reason today i'm going to tell you about a thing called zero knowledge proof so in the zero knowledge proof there are two people there's approver and a verifier and i want to prove that something is true to you but the weird thing is i want to prove to you that it's true without telling you any reasons why i remember when i first heard about it i was like wait what how could that possibly be right yeah so what do you see in this photo a lot of penguins yeah hidden among all these penguins is a puffin do you want to try to look for it do you see where it is hmm i know where it is but i don't want to tell you do you believe me you're not sure to believe me right yeah but what if i could prove to you that i know where the puffin is without revealing to you where it is let me show you i took that photo that we showed you and i put it behind this poster here why don't you go take a look through that hole i see the puffiness so when you look at this board we don't know where the photo was right was the photo like with the corner here in which case the puffin would be all the way at this side or was the photo with the corner here because the buffing would be on the other side so this is a really simple example of a zero knowledge proof i convinced you that i knew where the puffin was but you didn't learn anything else why do you study zero knowledge proof when i first learned about them i just thought they were so cool but it turns out they're also really useful not just for finding like puffins if you just type in your password and the hacker hacks into the computer they can just get your password right yeah what if instead we could somehow use a zero knowledge proof to log in you would just be able to prove that hey i'm chelsea without revealing anything to them if you could do that then it would be amazing right yeah because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer he wouldn't learn anything because even the computer doesn't learn anything so chelsea in your own words what is azure knowledge proof zero knowledge proof is proof to a statement you don't show them why or what you just show them a tiny segment or just do some sort of weird magic trick that's not really a magic trick and they will be convinced and you didn't show them why or anything like that
2,so have you ever heard the term zero knowledge proof before i have not no right it's a way for approver to convince a verifier that something is true without revealing anything about why it's true which sounds totally bizarre right like how can that possibly be what i want to do is prove to you that i know this combination without revealing the combination to you and what you could do is you could write a little note a secret that i definitely wouldn't know fold it up stick it in here and then if i know the combination i should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote all right there we go all right so my dog is named doug did you figure out what the combination was no so nowhere in this interaction did you see any information that you didn't already know and yet i convinced you that i know the combination right yeah so what's the exact purpose of azure knowledge proof is it like proving something but without giving enough information that could endanger whatever it is you're proving so you're asking like why shouldn't i just share my secrets with somebody people don't trust each other and if i was able to prove that i've done something correctly to someone without having to reveal my secrets then that person would trust me more how does this relate to computer technology like do you type it into a computer and somebody else receives it or is it an in-person interaction suppose you wanted to exchange messages with someone that you knew what would you guys do you'd probably first get together and like figure out some secret code right and then like write messages to each other in that code but what if you've never met the person before what if you want to exchange secret messages with me and we've never met each other before how could we possibly do that i have no idea it sounds impossible but it does but it's not we wouldn't use like a physical lock or a physical box we would instead use mathematics to do these kinds of things you could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics and then i could prove to you that i know the key i could open it up and send it back to you that way i would be proving to you that i know the mathematical key to the mathematical lock box so based on what we've discussed today in your own words what is a zero knowledge proof it's like if you have this really important secret that you want somebody to know about but you don't want to tell them everything you can use as your knowledge proof to prove to them that secret but not give away all of it
3,what are you studying i'm a first-year computer science student at usc viterbi i'm interested in all things like data and internet and blockchain and cryptocurrency have you ever heard of zero knowledge proofs only in passing so actually in the blockchain space is one of the spaces where we are seeing zero knowledge proofs being implemented and uh and i think it's just the beginning let's talk about zero knowledge proofs at its core a zero knowledge proof is an interaction between two people then i should be able to convince you that some statement is true but you won't have any idea why it's true well like understand that it's true because like you know the operations performed in the proof are like of a certain like you know they have like certain attributes that would make them true what you're basically asking me is wait what right right so this is what makes cyrano's proof so fascinating and so counterintuitive and i think the best way i can i can explain it to you is by by means of an example but before we do that i have to decide what i'm going to prove to you in a with a zero-knowledge proof and the way we're going to approach this is through something called np completeness what an np-complete problem is it's a problem that's really hard to solve but if you can solve it you can solve any problem that's in the class np and that includes a vast number of problems and what we're going to do is we're going to use an np complete problem to actually prove an incredible variety of statements through a zero knowledge proof and the specific and complete problem that we're going to be looking at is called map three coloring okay so here we have a map okay and these are a bunch of countries and we've arranged them so that no countries that have the same color share a border that's what makes a map like this validly colored and now you might think well why should we care it turns out that whether or not a map can be three-colored in this way is an example of an np-complete problem and it turns out that you know maybe what you really want to do is you want to give a zero-knowledge proof that you have at least point three bitcoins right that would be cool yeah without revealing what the address is of your of your account it turns out i can take that statement that i have at least point two bitcoins and convert it into a map of countries and that map of countries will be three colorable like this only if you have at least point two bitcoins how would we turn something like this into a zero knowledge proof of course the first step is we have to erase all the colors what i've done is i've put a color inside each of these envelopes now how do you know that it's a valid coloring you don't right you have to pick any two neighboring countries you can pick them however you like at random can i get these two these two all right sounds good right here we have green right and over here we have blue okay and as you can see there are two different colors right so you have a little bit of confidence right that i have managed to color this correctly but not that much confidence because i've only shown you two of the countries yeah right so now of course one way to get more confidence is to open up more of them for you but that would be revealing information to you i don't want to do that so instead i'm going to ask you to please turn around and now let's change up these colors can you pick two countries at random and we'll reveal to the colors again okay this one and this one nice and they're smart of you to check with the same one of the ones you already had right but as you will see now it's not green it's blue and this one on the other hand is three okay the colors i showed you last time don't work with these new colors right this wouldn't have worked yeah because of this one right exactly right but it works for this coloring that i'm showing you right now so what we've done is we've made it impossible for you to put the pieces together and if you do this let's say a thousand times and if i correctly showed you different colors each thousand times you'd be really convinced and that's it that's the entire zero knowledge proof oh okay so is it like there's no like actual like explicit like step one step two step three it's just like a probabilistic yeah in actual implementations we wouldn't use envelopes we would use encryption right but it's really this is the protocol so what are the broader implications of like zero knowledge proofs are they supposed to be like more practical for like implementation and are they supposed to like structurally prove something it's not about making something more efficient it's about doing things that we just didn't know how to do before i can actually prove to you without revealing to you any of my secrets that i use to behave honestly right i could prove to you that i signed some encrypted document correctly right without revealing to you what that secret document was that ability to change the game like really just change what we can do is what zero knowledge brings to the table where do you think we could build like more trust using like zero knowledge proofs and like its implementations one great example is like in elections if you could prove that an election was correctly conducted that every vote was counted and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total in zero knowledge then you don't have to give up the actual votes of any person and yet everyone could see that hey yeah it was done correctly
4,it's so great to have you here and talk with you eli um can you tell me a little bit about your research my research is in cryptography specifically i'm working on some various multi-party computation protocols the one i'm working on right now is a system for computing aggregate statistics so that service providers like google chrome or tesla can collect those statistics without learning anything about individual users data that's awesome i as a user don't have to let firefox know that my favorite website is mylittlepony.com but they can know how many users go to mylittlepony.com every day that's near and dear to my heart not a party competition obviously zero knowledge proofs are about proving things to another person without revealing the details of what it is that you're proving but you know in my mind zero knowledge actually goes even further beyond that it's like this overarching concept that you can see a lot in multi-party computation where you want to accomplish some sort of task without revealing anything more than exactly what you need to accomplish that task right and it allows you to prove that you've been behaving honestly without revealing any of the secrets involved that you used to actually behave honestly so we of course know that zero knowledge proofs for np complete languages play such a huge role in cryptography i'm curious what was your first experience with empty completeness like yes so my first encounter with np completeness was in my very first algorithms class that i took as an undergraduate so that was my first introduction is that an np complete language is this amazing problem that not only tells you about itself but solving this problem can actually tell you about an entire class of really interesting problems we first started thinking about proofs as an interactive game where we're talking to each other that made journalists possible absolutely right yeah and and the idea that randomness could be useful for proving something again seems so counter-intuitive if we think about this platonic ideal of a proof right there's no randomness there's no non-determinism that's present there and it has to do with you know this whole idea of flipping a proof on its head you know in an old classical proof randomness is specifically against the goal of what you're trying to do right because you're trying to make everything obvious and you're trying to reveal the flow of information indeed but once you flip that on its head and you're no longer trying to do that suddenly all of the bad properties of randomness become good exactly right because randomness is unpredictable and that's what we want right we want that unpredictability randomness to be utilized to actually hide the information that we want to hide how have you used your knowledge in the projects you've worked on what are the challenges that you find in my experience usually the hardest part is figuring out exactly where the best place is to use it i've written some papers in the past that have used zero knowledge in a more theoretical way but when it comes to applications some of the most exciting applications that i've seen so far have been in the blockchain space so what are some of the efficiency bottlenecks that you find in terms of efficiency uh one of the coolest things about zero knowledge proofs is that there's so many kinds i like to call them flavors i think that in general when you're using zero knowledge proofs in application the main bottleneck tends to lie on the approver can you take the provers job and split it up into lots of parallel computations right that's such a fun question it's such a great question and yeah i think i think we still don't know the answer to that as a field one of the coolest things i've seen over the past you know three or four years when i've been working on this kind of stuff is the transition from theoretical to applied and seeing all of these amazing systems that people thought of in the past 30 years start to actually get efficient enough to be actually made no doubt and especially with cloud computing exploiting the power of the cloud to enable zero knowledge proofs and to make use of journal electricity would be amazing right and also in the blockchain space for example if you want to speed up the generation of proofs if that could be done in a distributed way then that would be great one of the hopes that i have is that the power of multi-party computation is about bringing people together who are mutually distrustful yeah right so can we take that power that's there in the cryptography and use it to somehow help with the tremendous level of mistrust that exists in society right now in helping to bring groups of people together i think that's one of the reasons that i was so drawn to multi-party computation in the first place in my mind one of the most important problems in the world is the fact that so many people don't trust each other and to be able to actually use math to create technology that can allow people to work together without having to trust each other is a really cool and awesome mission i think
5,it's so great to see you again i think last time we met was in 2017 or something like that i think we zoomed once during the pandemic but it's good to see you in person right absolutely and actually in 86 i was taking a crypto class with professor edelman the a of rsa and he assigned me the paper by uh god of wasabi charlie redkov zero knowledge proof so that's indeed my first ever presentation ever in this country it was about zero knowledge that's what's up on zero knowledge yes such a almost hypnotic concept it's also an interesting um way how mathematically to formulate those concepts right for example we have data then eventually we said that from data like data mining you can get the information and then you have this word called knowledge right right so knowledge has been long debated even in philosophy what is knowledge but here is in a very fascinating way mathematicians or computer scientists right want to somehow capture knowledge they didn't say zero information proof right so so what's your take on why knowledge is rather than information or zero data proof clearly this data there so can't be zero data absolutely i don't think we still have a completely satisfactory answer to that question what was so such a beautiful insight as i'm sure you know is that the idea of zero knowledge being something that you can already predict right if you can already predict the answer then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction this insight of being able to predict the future accurately and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge was such a beautiful insight such an amazing insight why not zero information here fundamentally i uh clearly from computing perspective security perspective it's a how much knowledge you gain i guess more than how much information you gain and how much data you have right so that big data doesn't immediately imply a knowledge but people can sometimes right sometimes i mean for example in medical research how amazing would it be right to be able to have a drug and be able to prove that my drug works in this model and yet not have to actually reveal the structure of the compound what uh currently you think it would be the next directions in one of these next big things yeah this concept of zero knowledge programs would allow you to carry out completely arbitrary computations in a zero knowledge way without any interaction right i can just take the program convert it to a zero knowledge program or an obfuscated program and then just send it to you right and then you can run it and gain the benefit of that computation without having to talk to me anymore that's right there's non-interactive nature the non-interactive nature but with verification verifiability in it sometimes when for example when you have multi-protocol exchange that's it you know just like random numbers showed up you have to enter the random number as a participation authentication right now yeah clearly i think in blockchain they also began to incorporate more uh their knowledge proof in the ledger we're definitely at this moment now where zero knowledge is going to be used more and more there's so many uh conferences and meetings that that occur in the zero knowledge space where you and i are not invited because it's for the people who are who are developing it the people who are programming not as mathematicians yes yes and i think that's a sign that's a sign that our baby has grown up and you know it's time for it to be developed i think profoundly the students often also ask me what are the future direction both in terms of crypto zero knowledge proof in the real world and how mathematically you see in computing it's a great question i know i wish i could see the future i i can't actually but let me try the part of that that i'm the most comfortable answering is of course the mathematical side i think that there is you know we've done so much in cryptography over the last few decades but we understand so little you know even today we understand so little and i think the most fundamental aspect of that is understanding hardness how do we get hard problems how do we actually build mathematically hard problems so that we can then use them to build efficient zero-knowledge programs and efficient or knowledge proofs right i guess also with quantum computing you need even harder problems indeed absolutely you know now that we have we have the specter of quantum computing coming at us and we all know that quantum computers can break a lot of cryptographics that's profound challenge it's a profound challenge so can we find new sources of hardness that are quantum resistant even quantum computers can't break and that's something i've been working on for the last several years but i'd be very excited to see what happens in that in that space but i'm sure they will motivate beautiful mathematics yes that's right you know one of the great things about the real world is that people in the real world have demands and those demands often sound impossible and that's where we come in it's our job to make the impossible
1,we're here today to talk about memory when i say the word memory what comes to your mind like i once went on vacation to the dominican republic i think i was like six or five years old so on your trip what was the funnest day ever there's this pool i love pools and then there's just slide can go down and there's pool noodles there too and then there's a little tiny sandbox it's pretty amazing right because it happened like a year or two ago our memory is basically a record in our brain of something that happened in the past but that record it created isn't perfect so that day do you remember was the pool at your hotel i don't really remember do you remember from that day what color towel you used when you got out of the pool i think the one i used was a dark blue or a light blue or or like sort of a teal when you were telling me about the sandbox felt like you didn't have to make that guess that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes i asked you about the towel it doesn't come to mind immediately but you can stop and think about it and kind of make a good guess because there are things you know about the world and for those of us who study memory that's a really strong hint as to how memory works and so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff and all the stuff that was important to you but the details like did you have to have a ticket to get in or how you got there all these other less interesting less exciting aspects your brain kind of decided i'm letting go of all that information i think it's get older you start forgetting things more because you have to make space for new things which is why i forget stuff yeah that's a great insight basically we can't remember everything so when you tell us this memory of that vacation and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie of a memory a moment a day that you had in your life a while ago where do those memories come from i do know that there's different parts of the brain so there's probably a part of a brain that remembers a bunch of stuff the hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you kind of took it out and looked at it it looks a lot like a seahorse and it plays a really important role in creating those kind of memories that help you two years after your vacation share with me um what happened that day all these details of that day there's another part of the brain it's actually also important for memory and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping all the kind of emotional processing going from memory so memory for things that are really scary it's going to talk to the hippocampus now and get that memory to be really strong why do you think it might be important to remember scary things let's say you you accidentally cut yourself then your brain makes a no and says don't get too close to sharp things or you're going to cut yourself again you got it and so we don't just remember everything and we don't remember random things we remember the things that matter to us the most so abigail based on our conversation today can you tell me what is a memory a memory is something stored in your hippo campus and your hippocampus is a part of your brain it's just a big record and sometimes you can forget parts of the record that's not that important to you you got it what do you know about memory i know when you see something you could like kind of like picture it like in your head you can imagine it i remember
2,let's say like a year or two you might think like oh that day i got water you know on one hand memory is like a record of something that happened in the past that we can carry with us and we can like bring it back to mind and on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious sometimes because we might get it wrong in what world would that memory of the orange juice maybe be useful let's say you grow up in a place that don't work juices and then you go on vacation going somewhere and then it might like change how you feel about orange juice sometimes you know memory is doing something much simpler but no less important for us which is it's helping us figure out what's good and what's bad and if we can remember what's good and what's bad from what we did in the past that can help us make decisions about what to do next time so dylan you may be surprised to learn this but we asked your mom what some of your favorite candies are so you have to make a decision between these two candies and whichever one you pick you actually get to take with you i wish i could just say both but ah i guess i'll go with pixie six there you go there's your decision okay you can take those it took you some time there you look like you were really working hard at that problem and that's interesting because actually we know that from research that when people have to make a decision between two things they like equally some people like economists think oh those are the easiest decisions because they're both good options but as psychologists and neuroscientists we know it's the opposite and one of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of like i know that one's better i'm just going to go with it and so we think that that's the kind of decision where memory is especially important because you have to kind of come up with more information exactly and then also like after it's like maybe like i would enjoy this more than that and like maybe i should chose everyone and you don't know everything you just said is exactly what we know from research all the thoughts running through your mind were really a kind of about a prediction into the future right you're like how how will this taste if when it's in my mouth or how will i feel about my decision down the road you know we think of memory as something in the past but it's an example of how you use your memories of these two candies to predict what's going to happen in the future so that you can make a decision in the present but you did it you made your way through that yeah um torture and now you've got to keep the candy am i always gonna like choose pixie stix or sour patch kits what's gonna like change that we fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time but also the way we make decisions will change because our memories change what's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is especially sensitive to rewards to things that are exciting and positive it's a phase of life where those rewards whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is exciting can have an especially powerful control over the decisions you make and the memories you create 
3,is there any particular memory for you that you feel has been either kind of influential and you're in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort of emblematic of what it is to have a memory i was probably six years old and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer she battled it for 20 years she got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure cancer and i will never forget running into my aunt's room and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope it was a tiny little blue one and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes and it just that memory will never be forgotten my whole life i've got one too i was nine and we were at the science expo in san francisco two scientists were dissecting um an eye a cow's eye and i was like that is the coolest thing i've ever seen and there's something about that that carried me forward something happened so long ago it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits and it continues to shape the decisions we make about what to study and what to do just being able to apply those memories in the future is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans and the fact that we're learning how that works and i would love to hear more about your side of memory and the mechanisms that you're studying so we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors and we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory are organized and different structures of the brain and then to understand how those different structures work together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors like decision making or reasoning and thinking so in your researcher you focus more on implicit or explicit memory my work is actually kind of pushed against that distinction between memories that kind of are consciously accessible versus unconscious when you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit and explicit memory as anything different if you were to take a step back what would you define as implicit in explicit memory the best way to kind of think about that distinction really goes back historically to one of the most important discoveries in memory research the patient is referred to famously as patient hm the neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that happened to be right around the hippocampus on both the left side and the right side of hm's brain but then they started noticing something odd in his behavior he was not able to create new memories of the experiences he had after the surgery and that led brenda milner and her colleagues to report that the hippocampus was very important for memory but of one particular kind these sort of explicit or as we now refer to them episodic memories but the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills like mirror tracing things that you can't necessarily articulate but you just get better at over time and it really led to a couple of decades or more even of an enormous amount of very important work that kind of kept on breaking memory down further and further into different types episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened like what you did yesterday morning and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world implicit memories being broken down into a bunch of different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning and when i started graduate school many of us felt kind of the next question was really to understand how do we now understand how they work together this was right around when functional magnetic resonance imaging started becoming a popular tool for measuring brain activity we could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions about multiple brain regions at once and we discovered that when we might expect during a skill learning task that only the stratum might show activity that we also saw activity in the hippocampus or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex and so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about how different forms of memory interact together with the development of new tools for studying the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust our view of memory systems to think of them less as multiple completely separate independent systems and instead to try to understand how they really work in concert with each other and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit neatly into one category or another are the connectivities that you're seeing using the fmri in your studies are they different when you look at the implicit and explicit memories are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex yeah you know things are kind of breaking down in unexpected ways i'd say i think there's been a lot of really great work out of multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories but which might depend on episodic memories right so for example also when you're making a decision about how to choose between two good options that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus related to the choice itself others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus not only when people are forming memories but also when they're imagining events that are going to happen in the future so it kind of forces to rethink the way we define what the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for creating memories thinking about the future making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve what we would refer to in the field as relational processing and that raise all kinds of new questions about what memory really is reminiscing about our early influences that made us want to be scientists is that you know of course we know we know better than to think that those are necessarily accurate memories you know this reminds me of sort of the classic example from literature when people talk about memory of course is marcel proust's madeleine in remembrance of things past where in the book it's this um uh taste for the for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of the madeleine cookie in the tea that bring him back to his childhood you know seven volumes then emerge of memories of of that childhood digging further into earlier drafts of proof's novel that initially it didn't describe a medline at all it's very interesting to see the imperfections of the human brain and being able to rewrite something that happened to you and fully believe it yourself i think that that's one of the coolest errors in faults in the human brain that could exist you know i think these imperfections i interpret them as an indication that the role of memory is much less about being accurate representation of the past and much more about being kind of a flexible compass into the future 
4,so what are you studying these days well um i'm preparing my dissertation the general topic is going to be how we perceive different types of social stimuli like different people's faces and make judgments about them and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads what i love about what you were describing is like if you didn't use the word memory we're how you were talking about kind of perceptions and social judgments but i think probably we'd both agree that memory is a big part of course right like it reminds me so much of you know what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning on one hand we might have like a one-shot memory a memory of something that we saw yesterday like what we did or what we ate or where we were but a lot of our memories and our knowledge instead are based on many many many experiences oh absolutely um i think this sort of reminds me of another project that i'm doing it's fairly easy to get different participants to experience consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study i might not react the same to like this like cute cat video than someone else and i definitely believe that people's memory that they're bringing up unconsciously when they're experiencing something to make an emotional judgment informs especially our experience of positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion some of those examples really remind me also some of the questions about kind of abnormalities in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory and how they also play out in terms of not just what people remember but what they do with those memories right as far as the way that my research plays into it is like the first step in making a judgment about what to do based on an experience we're calling for memory is deciding what your emotional response was i think what we're still kind of trying to understand as a field is the more kind of detailed and bigger picture of where does this model live how does it get updated based on experiences why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not there are actually people who are born without a hippocampus they have disruptions to episodic memories they have trouble after this conversation or remembering what the conversation was about but they do have pretty good semantic information they have a good sense of knowledge about the world that's interesting for two reasons one it shows this dissociation between the role of the hippocampus and these two forms of memory episodic memories and semantic memory but the other reason it's interesting is that people often assume that we get to semantic memory through episodic memory that we encounter one dog and then another dog and then another dog and then we learn the concept the semantic notion of a dog and these people their profiles suggest that you can learn semantic information you can learn general knowledge about the world even without ever having the capacity to build those individual memories in people with intact brains you might use a particular process but that if that brain region that subserves that process is damaged that it's not that you can't do it anymore you just now do it a different way it's really hard to tell people like just don't use your memory to do this and we just sort of have to infer and guess at what strategies that they're doing if there's a particular research question that the answers you think is going to inform the research in your lab and perhaps in the rest of your field you know when i look back at some of the work from my own lab and in the field in general i really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries were not an answer to a question that was around before but they were discoveries that made us realize we weren't asking the right question i think one example of that even has to do with the connection between memory and decision making there was a discovery about how the stratum response to rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped the way we thought about the role of reward and learning and memory and may force us to realize there was something fundamentally connected between these processes and that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions that didn't exist before yeah i guess then the trick is we need to be designing studies that will make us most likely to find those sort of unexpected things which is kind of funny it's like how do you look for something that you don't know what it is each project should be very focused and rigorous and know what a study is designed for but at the same time we have to keep our minds open our eyes open for what else is happening some of the most interesting discoveries didn't make sense at first as someone who is studying social phenomena i like to hear that there you go exactly
5,thanks so much for coming um it's great to see you it's been a while it has been a while i'm really excited to be here it'd be great to just um start by talking about your work at the broadest level to my mind your work has really revolutionized the field of cognitive neuroscience more broadly i've been really interested in how it past understandings of the brain have really focused on on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does but i think that there's also a broader conversation happening in the brain which is between one region and another so it's actually the pattern of connections between these regions that would allow for the flow of information but i think the tools that have become widely available now from the physics community and mathematics and and computer science are under the umbrella of of network science so that is a science of networks a science of understanding how um bits of a system are interconnected with one another not just comparing two groups of people or two kinds of two species but we can ask even within a single person how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change as we talk with one another how does the information flow change i think a lot about traffic on roadway networks as a good example of this which is you know we can understand where the roads are and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed they change over long time scales and that's similar to the brain we really only create large scale connections over long time scales but we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily and and that's similar to what we do in in the brain is that we change the way that information is flowing to allow us to respond um to our environment it's a great analogy you know i remember when i first learned of your work for me as somebody who studies learning and memory which are processes that are all about rapid updating that to me was really mind-blowing that we can now start asking questions about dynamics of circuits on a time scale that's much closer to the time scale of human thought than anything we had before the field is definitely opening up in the kinds of questions that can be asked now with these approaches and i think what you're pointing out is that conceptually it's where we want it to go anyway so there's so much orchestration that happens and a symphony is not a single piece it's not a single pattern of harmony between instruments and similar to the brain symphony of your brain is not a single pattern it's a very dynamically changing pattern in the field we often talk of having a mental model that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding of what's going on what does that look like in terms that come from your world of like the configuration of a circuit i think this is the most exciting area of memory research right now i think which is um how people build and remember you know and keep with them models of the world over long periods of time when i think about a mental model i think about ideas uh potential outcomes potential events potential actions and how they all depend on one another so when we predict what will happen next it would be i'm currently sitting at this piece of the network and i know that there are there are these possible outcomes and so i have to get ready for those you know four possible outcomes but that brings this interesting question uh to the four i think which is how does a network system in our mind and our brain create a network model of the world outside it's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of what's inside and the hardware and what we're building in a very abstract way and i think that relates to some interesting work that's coming out about the hippocampus too we now think of the hippocampus um so much in terms of memory and but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation and it really exposed i think one of the deepest questions in memory research at least from the neuroscience perspectives like well what is the connection what is the connection between spatial processing and memory and um why is it that neurons in the hippocampus when an animal is navigating amaze why is it that there's spatial specialization there i really do think that this notion of a mental model uh generative model is where those where memory and space meet that makes a lot of sense and i think that um it makes me you know wonder how we think about places in the abstract what is a cognitive place right and what is how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we that our our mind moves within in the same way or in a similar way to the spaces that we physically walk in but i think it opens a lot up a lot of questions about how individuals make their own maps right and then how the way that they choose to make that map will then affect the way that they may respond in the future to a new context or environment yeah that's really interesting and i think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive and circular role of memory right because the maps are dependent on memories they're built from memories and experiences so there's this um kind of dialogue with memory creating maps maps creating experiences phrases creating memories affecting the maps and it really makes me think even a question a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of trapped in a state of mind where all they can see is a particular way forward but then something happens in the world that shifts them to another model which is actually really interesting because you can make different maps in different physical spaces too right as you walk into a new room you make a new map of that room so what are the doorways basically for for mental models and i think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of of thinking about memory as as always additive that we always just keep gathering more information and update what we currently have we don't as often speak about deleting pieces of information or or perceptions or something that we thought was a was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact memories as models or models first and memory as part of what helps build a model starts generating new predictions exactly of the kind you just brought up or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient model needs to let go of information right i've just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that the principles of neuroscience textbook keeps growing and growing and that if we had enough strength in theoretical neuroscience if our models of neuroscience were good enough that book should shrink back we know that memory retrieval is essentially construction and so you don't need to store all those separate memories you need to construct them but if you have a good model let go of all those details and just construct them to feel as if it's a memory but really all you're doing is using the model to fill the details it's kind of like the matrix you know it's getting way out there but um but it is a way in which if you have the right model it should be an efficient one i wonder what you think what you think about um what all this means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion and would you be willing to try to help me think about how to define it i think it's information um certainly that had that is stored in the brain and that can then affect our behavior i think getting a behavior in there somewhere seems seems important but also is it just a record of the past or is it you know our perceptions of of what happened in the past or how we've changed uh how we think about that past event or have we deleted that event completely and then gathered this higher level structure or mental model that then allows us to behave differently in the future so it's more alive it's more changing it's more i think it's bubbling out in gathering gathering and growing and becoming more flexible but it's also sort of bubbling in in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting um so yes i think that what we need to add perhaps is that changeability and the behave perhaps the behavioral relevance of that changeability yeah what do you think i i agree i i think you know as you were speaking i was thinking the maybe the most important words were placed there is record the record implies an etching of something as it was and maybe what we need instead is that it's a model um it's an approximation it's an abstraction um that can help us create the illusion of constructing a record but that it's the model that's the important thing that drives the whole thing yeah yeah i agree i think that's perfect yeah i hope you learned something about memory it plays a role in shaping the changing preferences of things we encounter in our lives memory is fundamental to everything we do to who we are to what we order for breakfast to how we think about our past to how we plan our future
1,you like science yes a lot oh very good you come to the right place so we're gonna think about physics have you heard the word physics before do you know what that is what's your idea what physics is I'm not so sure okay I just think of physics as you know the study of everything what stuff is what stuff does so today we're going to talk about space and in particular the idea of dimensions have have you heard about dimensions I think I mean I ain't enough 3d printing 3d printing good no I own keys the size all I have to do with the shape but you know what 3d means it's free dimensional three dimensional as opposed to what is ordinary printing so ordinary printing would be 2 d what do you say when something is one-dimensional what's an example of something it's one-dimensional a line is the perfect example because it's one thing that's straight right so here's some toys we're gonna build some dimensions right so what would you say about this that's 1 exactly it's not really one dimensional everything has to be one or two dimensional before it's free dimensional and how would you find yourself like if someone said where are you like could you use some words or ideas to say where you are on that line I think I would be a maybe there since I'm facing it but here's what I wanted to think about if I say I'm at this point on the line I could translate that into saying I'm at the three-centimeter point if I were here I via the four-centimeter point the five-centimeter point right so every point every location on our little line has its own unit as its own unit has one number we need one number to tell you where we are that's one dimension that's what it means to be one dimensional I only need to tell you one number to figure out where we are because if it's like a sphere you kind of have to start using points there you go exactly we're gonna build a little two dimensional space you wanna do it you wanna do the honors here why don't you put those two lines together if you make it mental is this a corner exactly another way is if you are two spacing between is an angle I think you should be in this chair and he should be explaining this to me you're much better than this than I am yeah so those are the dimensions that's how we think about dimensions remember we just needed one number to find ourselves on the line we need two numbers to find ourselves on the plane I think that would be an X or Y axis there you go so do you think we could have more than three dimensions 3d is the maximum of dimensions for shapes well as far as we know this is why physicists think about things we don't know about we're wondering whether it could be extra dimensions you've never seen that are tinier than atoms so okay so what have you learned what do you know about dimensions now how do you think about dimensions in a slightly different way than you did before so at least everything has a certain dimension yeah do you think he'd be excited a physicist said that they found extra dimensions of space that would be the news would be spreaded around the world rocket I think so I think you're right all right Hank we want you to you know keep up studying learn a lot of math and physics and help us discover new dimensions someday does that sound like a fun idea yeah
2,do you like science doesn't think about what kind of science I like biology and computer science all right you're in the wrong place we're not gonna be talking about biology computer science so we want to talk about the idea of dimensions the other dimension is how you define dimensions I guess I don't know how to exactly define it but I know like the first floor right you know the difference between like one dimension dimensions three dimensions etc so let's do a little experiment here so there's one dimension I'll give that to you now here's here's your task I'm gonna give you another dimension and I'm gonna ask hold those two things at right angles to each other it's easy to do so there's no trace here I'm not trying to pull you here okay now this will be slightly trickier I'm going to give you this I want you to hold all three of them at right angles to all the others at the same time there you go so what that's doing is when you had just two that was describing a two-dimensional plane right like the two things pick out a plane the three things pick out all three dimensional space now we'll give you one more I'm gonna ask you to hold that fourth one so that it's at a right angle to all the other three at the same time all right now I am can't be done you can't do it so we just experimentally proved that space is three-dimensional that's sort of what it means to be three-dimensional that there are three different directions you can move in and there's not four or five or six directions you can move in okay there you go three dimensional space right mm-hmm so have you thought about using coordinates in three dimensions yeah I was actually doing SAT prep there you go it showed like the x y&z axis as well that's right so that's exactly what these would be have you heard that there are other coordinate systems other than XYZ no but we could also say how far we are away from the center just the distance and then the angle that our little line makes with that's a B X ax yeah so that's a different way of giving you two numbers and locating yourself and we called polar coordinates is a different coordinate system well we want to do as physicist is look for extra dimensions can you imagine can you think of any way that there could be extra dimensions time time yes Einstein that said that we can think of time as a fourth dimension and that's a very fascinating thing that we could talk about all by itself but what about space what about the solar system like if you wanted to tell me where a certain star was in the sky do you know what how we do that I have no idea it's it's exactly the same thing as latitude and longitude but we put coordinates on the sky so astronomers call them right Ascension and declination which are two terrible words but basically you've seen you know on the globe where you draw latitude and longitude what it looks like yeah there are the peals of an orange kind of thing right yeah so you can define something as well you know how high above a certain location on earth it is but the earth is rotating and revolving around the Sun so we have to define separate celestial coordinates so there's like mold how many dimensions would there be we don't know you know the optimistic view is that there are six but the thing is some of them might be really really really really really small like way too small for us to ever see yeah and some of them might be medium sized that hopefully we can see okay so since it's all theoretical like this could not be three dimension and this is sort of the state of uncertainty that physicists are stuck living out you know honestly out there if you go out onto campus and talk to the physicists half of them will say probably extra dimensions exist and have them say no that's just nonsense okay after all this yeah someone comes up to you on the street and says what's a dimension oh man I mean I guess what I've learned today is just that there are not just three dimensions or at least we think I mean everything's theoretical it's all just really kind of confusing that's right and you know if they're still bugging you you can just like give them some sticks and act as we're together and that would shut them up yeah
3,you study I'm gonna be a sophomore from ona college and I study math and physics Oh math and physics okay what kind of physicists do you want to be you know I really don't know I like theory and experimental so it's kind of tough for me to say usually if it's math and physics you end up as a theoretical physicist right yeah experimental one so our theme here today is dimensions and so this is great that you have some math background some mathematicians think about dimensions in a different way yeah so how would you explain to you know your friends who are not math and physics majors like what is it dimension yourself my first intuitive thought is water like the coordinates you know so if we were looking at things we're looking like a dot that's like one or a line rather that's one dimensional because we can only measure it one way but now if we look at like a square then we're increasing like that so it's like all basically the what coordinates we can use to measure something that's exactly right and so you've heard of space time yeah being four-dimensional right now in some sense that's kind of trivial to you and me because of course you have space which is three-dimensional you have time which is one dimensional so space-time is four-dimensional but it didn't turn out it didn't occur to anyone that that was a sensible way to talk until really relativity this is the crucial thing right is that what Einstein realized is that sure there's both time and space but how we divide space time into time and space can be different for different people and really there's a real sense in which four-dimensional space-time is kind of a generalization of three-dimensional space and I think to really explain this we're gonna need a blackboard okay let's bring what it all right think about relativity is that they really want you to think of space-time as one four-dimensional thing right it's kind of like space it's not just three dimensions of space in one dimension of time why though why this is a very good question so let's just start with space right you know a little bit about space so here's my simple-minded way of drawing space two dimensions because that's how many I can draw on the blackboard let's say x and y and what is special about space there's many things but one is that if I have you know a curve or a path between two points there's a distance that you can calculate right and the distance between those two points doesn't depend on your coordinates it doesn't depend on whether you're in radial coordinates or Cartesian coordinates or whatever I'm allowed to imagine a curve that does something like this between those two points and if I were a person walking on that curve I would have an a domitor with me maybe and I would know you you would know even without having done that this path has always going to be longer than that there's a formula I thank you mrs. theorem it tells you what the shortest distance path is that's the point the physicalness of what is real is the distance along a certain curve so space-time is like that that's why it is useful to think about space okay so let me draw space-time is how we usually draw it I'll just say X but all of space is condensed this one direction and this is time okay so if you're a little person you start at some event so you start you're located somewhere in space somewhere the three coordinates of space and whether you like it or not you're moving through space-time just by getting older yeah when people ask me can you travel through time I say yes yesterday I traveled 24 hours into the future and Here I am you know the day later so that's just this okay you're moving through time like that so what Einstein says is look I can travel through space-time in different ways like I could hop in a rocket ship and fly out and then fly back and then I can meet you there so this is a different trajectory through space-time right yeah and it's almost exactly like the space story the space story says there's a distance distance is different along different Irv's Einstein says there's something that measures the length of these curves and we call it the proper time it is literally the time that you would read on your wristwatch so it's kind of like our like fundamental time I got face time well kind of what Einstein wants to get across this there's no such thing as fundamental like there's the universe is time this big letter T that might you know tell you how old the universe is but then every individual has a clock with them and they measure their own time depending on how they're moving through the universes and the crucial difference is the time is not the same for this person who stayed behind and sat in their chair and this person who zoomed out there why is that this one is shorter than there is what we call a metric on space time and when we talk about Euclidean space versus a curved space versus a sphere or something that's a different metric and space-time has its own metric which says the following thing that the path between two events in space-time that is a straight line will always be the longest time I see okay that's the difference all right so what when I had this idea Oh gravity could be related to the curvature of space-time he did some equations okay so he got it that's a long story will satisfy what he figured out was that rather than gravity living on top of space-time it's a manifestation of the curvature of space-time so when you have like the earth the Sun the moon they cause a gravitational field they're actually warping the space-time around them they're giving it a different geometry would it be if I had like a spring off or not a spring like a like a sheet and I dropped like a book in the sheet curves down yeah exactly if you if you had a sheet that was originally flat and you know you sent a marble on it would go in a straight line then if you put something on it so it warps it that marble is now gonna be deflected I see Einstein says the gravity is just like that I see but there are no straight lines because space-time itself is curved so do you think if you had to explain relativity what would you say I think I'd go with like the kind of like the Train paradox let's say I'm stationary and someone's moving past me on the train they think they're stationary on the train like they think that they're not accelerating but if they start walking through the train cars then they are accelerating in their frame but then from my outside frame where I'm completely removed I see they're accelerating so I guess that relativity is all about perspective I guess in a way yeah that's right and it goes exactly back to what we drew on the board and we're how those two people in the Train and on the ground would divide space-time up differently you have to space in time that's pretty good yeah it's a lot of fun stuff to talk about so observational
4,cosmology so like what would he look at so I work on two ground-based surveys and the optical and we're basically trying to make huge maps of the universe so that we can study dark energy I'm sure you've heard about extra dimensions a little bit I've heard it yeah I'm thinking about the idea that there might be more than three dimensions of space what is your impression of theoretical physicists who think about things like extra dimensions of space that they haven't ever seen I get a little scared cuz I think oh how can you prove these theories right one theory I've heard of I don't know if this fits in with that is bubble universes it's not an extra dimension does that fit into that or is that something it does in fact one way that different universes might sort of be created and be different from each other is that different universes could have effectively different numbers of dimensions like we have three dimensions around us but there's people out there aliens who could live in five dimensional universes and are each of those dimensions do are they governed by the same laws of physics or is there like a separate lagrangian for each universe yeah how does that work we think that it would be you know all this is incredibly speculative and we don't know for sure but the idea is that there is some deep down underlying laws that are universal and the same but they show up differently so they appear different so the specific particles and forces and masses would be completely different in different parts of the multiverse okay why in the world would you think that there are extra dimensions right so you've heard of string theory I have so the string theory is basically a theory of quantum gravity mm-hmm so we have quantum mechanics right the theory of you know atoms and so forth and how those work and then we have gravity and gravity doesn't seem to fit in it's the one force of nature that we can't really easily fit into this quantum mechanical so string theory is one of the best right ideas that's the good news the bad news is that it only seems to work if space-time is ten dimensional so you would say well then it's wrong it can't be right space-time is not 10 dimensional space-time is four dimensional you've observed that but instead we say if space-time looks four dimensional to us but string theory which might be the best theory we have of quantum gravity says it must be 10 dimensional maybe we could hide those extra six dimensions somehow so here's how we could get lucky we could imagine that there are extra dimensions of space that are curled up somehow that are so small that we can't see them this is actually an old idea it goes back to Colusa and klein right after general relativity was invented in 1915 but there's a more recent idea that says there could actually be relatively large extra dimensions there could be extra dimensions that are actually that big like a millimeter across that you would not have noticed but here's the new exciting idea so let's imagine okay there's a piece of paper but let's imagine this is our entire world so in other words our real world is three dimensional but let's imagine that we're just idealizing it down to two dimensions so we all live here you and I live here but let's imagine that we're embedded in this bigger space so there are extra dimensions that are actually big ok let's imagine that when I say we live on this three dimensional world what I mean is imagine that the particles that you and I are made of right the quarks the leptons the electrons and everything all the forces we know about electromagnetism the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force imagine that they can't leave this surface this is what will we call a brain BR ane have you heard this word before right yes do you know where it comes from no from membranes you know we have lines one dimension we have two-dimensional surfaces so if you have a line that is a vibrating physical thing you call it a string right right if you have a two-dimensional surface that vibrates and is a physical thing we call that a membrane membrane theory goes back it never was as popular as string theory but it's been around for a while but if you have extra dimensions of space then you can have three-dimensional vibrating things and four-dimensional vibrating things so how do these strings give rise to things like mass in charge and basically give us the properties of the particles we see well basically the strings are the particles that we see it's exactly the same thing as we said you know for the straw if you look at it far away it looks one-dimensional a little loop of string so a little one-dimensional circle that is vibrating if you look at it from very very far away it just looks like a particle so in string theory an electron is a little string a photon is a little string so is string theory part of what they call the grand unified theory is it's supposed to be the the last thing that sort of unifies all the forces together yeah string theory is even better so the phrase grand unified theory was coined in the 1970s for theories that joined electricity and magnetism so a good string theory is gravity plus a grand unified theory that's even better is the theory of everything what would you tell a friend of yours if they asked you what dimensions are what extra dimensions are what a brain is so we have three spatial dimensions a brain is sort of the next level so a brain is a higher dimensional object that vibrates through space that's right and we could live there the world we see around us the three dimensions of space around us could reflect the fact that we are somehow stuck on a three dimensional brain trying to escape it was really cool to learn about strings and brains and how looking at gravity on small scales is actually connected to what I do and looking at gravity on these cosmological scales and it's definitely something I'm going to think about in my research you're a string theorist so
5,tell us like what kind of string theory you do what it means to be you string theorists one of the things that's key in the whole story of string theory is the piece of it that talks about quantum theories of gravity so I'm very excited about what happens to space-time what does even mean at the quantum level cool so do you think a lot about extra dimensions in your everyday life yes I do and so when you think about extra dimensions you put them together with brains and different fields wrapping around the extra dimensions and so forth right yes you know a lot of people a lot of string theorists they care a lot about all the different ways in which we could hide the extra dimensions as someone who cares about cosmology I want to start asking why are the extra dimensions small at all how did happen is this something you think about yourself yes well ultimately we'd like to understand the observable universe if string theory turns out to be the thing that the universe cares about we'd like to know with all of these possibilities of the in string theory how do we get the one that looks like the world we live in the thing I want to talk about is this paper I wrote with Matt Johnson and Lisa Randall where we realized there's another way to compactify extra dimensions spontaneously dynamically if you imagine starting with this big piece of paper you couldn't wrap up everything but within some region of space you could make a tube okay right and down there in the tube it looks like you're a long thing that is compactified in one direction and infinitely extend in the other direction so there's one less macroscopic dimension of space okay I think that sounds plausible to you it sounds like fun what I would immediately ask is whether the large dimensions come from in the first place is that something you address or you just assume that large debate all the dimensions are large as a starting point yeah so we certainly assume that they're all large as a starting point and it's worse than that so in our paper we imagine you start in de sitter space you start in a universe with no matter no anything like that just empty space but with an energy that is positive and all the dimensions are large but where do they come from it was always there why why not okay this is replacing one prejudice for the different prejudice I would say that we shouldn't be prejudiced one way or the other just a large you know 10 or 11 dimensions with the cosmological constant doesn't seem like a fundamental starting point it's it sounds like there needs to be something to underlie that but it's a fun scenario yeah so let me tell you a little bit more about the scenario so you know there are black holes good right I've heard of them there are black brains as well why don't you explain to us what a black brain is well in some ways it's very much like a black hole and that you have far away from it you have these large just you know flat dimensions as you move in there's there's something in the it has itself higher dimensions and so because physicists love to joke they thought well it's like a membrane but it can have many different dimensions let's use P to stand in for those number of dimensions and so they call them P brain yeah I've been trying to explain them to lower levels and they always look at me like I like your a little bit or is this the real thing that they use yes it is the real thing they use we study these brains in de sitter space and so we what we found is that there are black brain solutions which instead of having a singularity inside our non singular and stable and compactified is this a familiar thing I know things like this have been discussed yeah yeah so a lot of the brains that are relevant for studying things to do with anti-de sitter spacetime x' in various dimensions actually start out as these non singular type brains and then you find in the core there's actually an entity sitter spacetime right imagine that rather than going down to a point it just ask some totes to some fixed radius and continues infinitely far down but then you can ask okay what about the rest of the university have like some sphere some two dimensions compactified and the balance between the cosmological constant and the electromagnetic field keeps it at a distance but then the other dimensions the transverse dimensions don't need to be anti-de sitter they can have either positive 0 or negative cosmological constant so you can basically get any sort of cosmological solution times a compactified sphere is it that these have the lowest action of all the things that could possibly all the possible solutions I guess I mean maybe maybe you think otherwise again or maybe we could change my mind I think that as long as it can happen it will happen some of the time right you mean the one of the things that could happen so I mean obviously you know we know one of them baby I stole that from Kenna Reeves I'm afraid someone probably wrote it for you so it's possible that if you do have this starting point of an empty de sitter space with positive cosmos constant some field flying around you inevitably get a multiverse it just happened you know it's just part of quantum nucleation two different things and then maybe you need to explain why we live in this universe rather than some other one via the anthropic principle or something like that so how does how does our kind of you know Tech old-fashioned way of making new universes intersect with the kinds of things you'd think about well it's interesting because there's a lot of activity going on inspired by things we learned from working in anti-de sitter space where the cosmological constant has you know right wrong sign so you will find that there are a number of papers as many of which you've probably read probably you've read more of them that I have which try then to take different kinds of brains these extended solutions or and there many different kinds doing different things we understand them well enough now that we can put them together in various ways they intersect they dissolve inside each other they and you do them all in all sorts of different ways and shows that you can construct four-dimensional universes with a cosmological constant of your desire depending upon how you did the construction not everyone buys that there's a big discussion in the literature right now and if we put aside for the second the concerns of our colleagues in other parts of physics and it's just amongst us chickens what do you think about the future of cosmology and string theory and the dynamics of these extra dimensions I think it's gonna get way more interesting than then we're currently able to grapple with right now and I think there are hints of it there could be a description of the physics that might be our early universe that is like that molecular description and then from that emerges flat space times maybe for maybe some mechanism tells you it's for not something else I think that's where we're going if the viewers want to know more about how space-time can emerge from quantum mechanics they could read the graphic novel you just wrote right yes I wrote in drew a graphic novel called the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe and I just wrote a book called something deeply hidden about many worlds quantum mechanics and how space-time can emerge from it plenty reading material for the audience out there excellent so that was fun I hope that everyone did learn something I know that I did it was very nice to see how the idea of dimensions and space resonates in different ways with different people all the way up to talking to Clifford about the forefront of modern research I really do think that we're not done understanding how dimensions work there are three dimensions of space why that why not - why not 27 I think that we really don't yet have the data or ideas to think about this but we're creeping up on it I'm optimistic about progress in the near future I'm a professor at the University of Waterloo and I'm a sleep scientist at UCSF today I've been challenged to explain lasers to explain the topic of sleep at five different levels
